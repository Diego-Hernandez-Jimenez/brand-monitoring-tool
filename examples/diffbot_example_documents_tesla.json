        "Cars /\nElectric Cars /\nTesla\nThe Tesla CEO has long promised driverless cars that can go anywhere. But now he’s acknowledging that there will be “parameters.”\nby Andrew J. Hawkins\n116 Comments116 New\nAndrew J. Hawkins is transportation editor with 10+ years of experience who covers EVs, public transportation, and aviation. His work has appeared in The New York Daily News and City & State.\nLast night, Elon Musk did what he does best: promise “millions” of autonomous Tesla vehicles would be on the road by the end of next year.\nIt’s become a familiar refrain. Every year since at least 2020, Musk has promised Tesla vehicles will finally achieve their full self-driving capabilities. And every year, those promises fail to come to fruition. Tesla has come under investigation for numerous fatalities involving its vehicles and its driver assist features, Autopilot and Full Self-Driving. His rivals continue to outpace him. And Musk has even acknowledged his overly optimistic outlook by labeling himself “the boy who cried FSD.”\n“I predict that there will be millions of Teslas operating autonomously, fully autonomously, in the second half of next year.”\nThat fantasy of millions of autonomous Tesla vehicles is getting closer to reality, Musk promised again last night. You’ll be able to sleep in your car and wake up at your destination by the end of this year, he vowed. As Tesla’s financial problems mount, the billionaire CEO seems eager to shift focus away from the drab realities of running a car company amid a tumultuous global trade war, and toward a more idealized vision of a future-focused company producing millions of robots, both humanoid and car.\nBut that fantasy is looking increasingly out of reach, especially as Musk confronts the limitations of Tesla’s technology, and the current political reality he helped usher in.\nDuring the call, it was clear that Musk is intent on continuing to pursue the goal of deploying fully autonomous vehicles using a camera-only sensor suite and an end-to-end neural network that’s been trained on billions of driving miles from the company’s fleet.\nTesla doesn’t have a PR department and stopped responding to questions from reporters almost six years ago. So often Musk’s claims about full self-driving go completely unchallenged, and rarely is he asked to defend his positions. Since his acquisition of Twitter, and its rebranding as X, Musk has been able to count on his legion of fans to amplify his promises about autonomous cars to the broader world, with little pushback.\nTesla’s earnings calls remain the last place where Musk fields questions about the company’s technology — and often those questions are packaged with a lot of fawning and ingratiating remarks from financial analysts who have developed parasocial relationships with the billionaire CEO over the past decade. But last night, Musk faced several pointed queries about Tesla’s plans to roll out driverless cars in Austin in just a few short months, as investors continue to struggle to parse reality from fiction.\nAs Tesla’s financial problems mount, the billionaire CEO seems eager to shift focus away from the drab realities of running a car company.\nLast year, Musk said that Tesla would rollout “unsupervised” robotaxis in Austin, Texas starting in June 2025. And in the call last night, Musk stuck to that deadline, but added a little more color about what to expect. He said the paid ridehailing service would consist of 10-20 Model Y vehicles with remote operators in case any of the cars get stuck. So unsupervised, but also teleoperated in case of emergency.\nTesla’s robotaxis will have “audio input” to listen for approaching emergency vehicles — well, at least some of them will, according to Ashok Elluswamy, VP of Autopilot and AI software. “The customer facing versions don’t have audio input, but the version that’s going to be in Austin will have audio input,” he said.\nMusk has long promised Level 5 autonomy, which describes driverless vehicles that can travel anywhere, under any conditions, without limitations. But last night, he corrected himself: there will be some limitations. A “blizzard in Manhattan,” for example, may be off limits for Tesla’s self-driving taxis. In other words, geofencing, a practice used by every other operator of autonomous vehicles, but typically shunned by Musk because it conflicts with his vision of an unfettered, decentralized fleet of driverless cars free to roam anywhere they want.\n“It’s increasingly obvious that there’s some value to having a localized set of parameters for different regions and localities,” Musk said.\nOne analyst asked about the reliability of Tesla’s cameras when confronting sun glare, fog, or dust. Musk claimed that the company’s vision system bypasses image processing and instead uses direct photon counting to account for “noise” like glare or dust.\nOther robotaxi operators have determined that cameras aren’t enough to reliably guide a driverless car through a complex environment. Companies like Waymo, which currently is doing 200,000 fully autonomous taxi trips each week, rely on a sensor suite that includes lidar, radar, and ultrasonic sensors for redundancy in case the vehicle runs into any difficulty. Musk calls lidar “a crutch.”\nDuring the call, Musk mocked Waymo’s approach as costing “way more money” than his company. Tesla builds its own cars, its own computers, and its own sensors. It’s more vertically integrated, which Musk argues give it the “leg up” over its rivals. Of course, he made no mention of the major hardware replacement that millions of Tesla vehicles will require in order to achieve their promise of full self-driving — a process he previously described as “painful” and expensive.\n“It’s increasingly obvious that there’s some value to having a localized set of parameters for different regions and localities.”\n“Teslas are… probably costing a quarter or 20 percent of what a Waymo costs and made in very high volume,” Musk said. “So, you know, ironically, we’re the ones that made the bet that a pure AI solution with cameras… is the right move.”\nHurdles remain, Musk admitted. Tesla will have “10 million autonomous cars” on the road in a few years, unless “we’re blocked by regulatory situations.” What sort of regulatory situations, he didn’t enumerate. Right now, there’s nothing standing in Tesla’s way from deploying dozens or even hundreds of driverless cars if it chooses. The Trump administration, led by Musk’s Department of Government Efficiency, have slashed thousands of jobs, including roles in regulatory agencies investigating the safety of Tesla’s self-driving systems.\nTariffs and the rising trade war could be a sticking point. Tesla’s Cybercab production could be disrupted after the company reportedly paused component imports from China thanks to President Trump’s 145 percent tariff on the county.\nWaymo’s fully driverless cars are currently operating in four cities, including Austin, with more on the way. Tesla has yet to demonstrate its cars can operate autonomously on public roads, preferring to stick to controlled demonstrations on closed lots or private roads.\nBut the real proof is right around the corner — if you continue to believe in Elon Musk’s promises.\n116 Comments116 New\nSee More:\nAutonomous Cars\nCars\nElectric Cars\nElon Musk\nTech\nTesla\nTranspo\nMost Popular\nMost Popular\nYouTube’s TV changes include a redesign and more multiview\nInstaller\nA weekly newsletter by David Pierce designed to tell you everything you need to download, watch, read, listen to, and explore that fits in The Verge’s universe.",
        "Andrew J. Hawkins is transportation editor with 10+ years of experience who covers EVs, public transportation, and aviation. His work has appeared in The New York Daily News and City & State.\nTesla released its first quarter financial earnings today, offering another peek into the crisis currently enveloping Elon Musk’s company.\nTesla said it earned $409 million in net income on $19.3 billion in revenue. That’s below Wall Street expectations of $21.1 billion and represents a 9.4 percent decrease year over year compared to $21.3 billion in revenue in Q1 2024. The company’s profits also slid dramatically, logging a 71 decrease in net income for the first quarter. And Tesla’s automotive revenue — the money is earns from car sales — slid 20 percent year over year, from $17.4 billion in Q1 2024 to $13.9 billion in this most recent quarter. The sale of $595 million in regulatory credits once again buoyed Tesla’s finances — without which the company would have had to report a year over year loss.\nIn a letter to shareholders, Tesla acknowledged that tariffs, as well as “changing political sentiment,” will continue to complicate efforts to grow out of its current rut.\n“Uncertainty in the automotive and energy markets continues to increase as rapidly evolving trade policy adversely impacts the global supply chain and cost structure of Tesla and our peers,” Tesla said. “This dynamic, along with changing political sentiment, could have a meaningful impact on demand for our products in the near-term.”\nTesla was expected to be largely insulated from tariffs, thanks to its domestic supply chain. But the company says that its energy business, which includes solar panels and home battery products, will be hurt by the Trump administration’s trade war. “While the current tariff landscape will have a relatively larger impact on our Energy business compared to automotive, we are taking actions to stabilize the business in the medium to long-term and focus on maintaining its health,” the company wrote.\nIn January, Tesla predicted that its sales would grow in 2025, but didn’t specify by how much. Now the company is rethinking that guidance and will update it after next quarter:\nIt is difficult to measure the impacts of shifting global trade policy on the automotive and energy supply chains, our cost structure and demand for durable goods and related services. While we are making prudent investments that will set up both our vehicle and energy businesses for growth, the rate of growth this year will depend on a variety of factors, including the rate of acceleration of our autonomy efforts, production ramp at our factories and the broader macroeconomic environment. We will revisit our 2025 guidance in our Q2 update.\nIt wasn’t all bad news: Tesla’s gross margins, 16.3 percent in the first quarter, came in above analysts’ expectations of 15.82%, according to estimates compiled by LSEG, Reuters reports.\nThe earnings comes on the heels of Tesla’s worst quarterly sales report in three years. The company said it delivered a total of 336,681 vehicles, a 12.9 percent decline compared to Q1 2024. (For a direct-to-consumer company like Tesla, deliveries are a proxy for sales.)\nAfter years of exponential growth, the sudden reversal in Tesla’s fortune has left many investors and supporters with whiplash. Tesla now serves as a sobering example of what happens when a company is left on autopilot (or Autopilot, as it were) while its high-profile CEO gets distracted by questionable side projects.\nThe sudden reversal in Tesla’s fortune has left many investors and supporters with whiplash\nTesla’s current troubles can be traced back to Musk’s position with the Department of Government Efficiency, or DOGE, a specious effort to cut “waste and fraud” in the government that appears mostly aimed at eliminating humanitarian aid programs, cancelling critical scientific research, and terrorizing federal workers. He has also amplified racist and antisemitic theories on social media, attacked trans people (including his own daughter), and made a fascist salute during Trump’s inauguration. Tesla’s shares are down over 37 percent year-to-date, as investors beg Musk to put aside his political activities and refocus his attention on his primary company.\nMeanwhile, Musk’s antics have spawned a nationwide protest movement called Tesla Takedown, aimed at boycotting the company and driving down its stock price. And it appears to be successful in persuading many progressive Tesla owners to sell their vehicles, despite steep drops in used car values.\nThere have also been an unrelated spate of violent attacks on Tesla stores and vehicles around the world, including several cases of arson and vandalism. President Donald Trump has said suspects caught defacing Tesla vehicles would be charged with “domestic terrorism.”\nMusk is pinning his hopes on AI, robotics, and self-driving cars, which he argues will propel Tesla to new financial heights. He claims the company will launch an “unsupervised” robotaxi pilot in Austin, Texas, in June. But his past promises about autonomous driving have failed to come true. And experts have questioned Tesla’s approach to the technology, pointing to dozens of fatal crashes that have occurred involving the company’s partially automated features.\nBut the company’s on-again, off-again pursuit of a lower cost EV is what best exemplifies Tesla’s off-the-rails moment. For years, Musk has been promising an affordable electric vehicle, likely priced at $25,000, as a way to broaden the appeal of plug-in vehicles. But instead the company spent precious resources on the polarizing, unpopular Cybertruck. And now recent reports suggest that Tesla’s efforts to build a more affordable Model Y — its most popular model — is significantly delayed.\nThe company reaffirmed its plans for new affordable models in the first half of 2025, noting in the shareholder letter that the changeover to the new assembly line for the refreshed Model Y also included prep for new vehicles later this year. “Given economic uncertainty resulting from changing trade policy, more affordable options are as critical as ever,” the company wrote.\nMusk and his executive team are expected to address all these issues and more in a call with investors at 5:30 pm ET. Tesla also said it would host a “live company update” including a question and answer session, in another sign that the company sees this moment as particularly fraught.

        "Andrew J. Hawkins is transportation editor with 10+ years of experience who covers EVs, public transportation, and aviation. His work has appeared in The New York Daily News and City & State.\nA Tesla Supercharger station was severely damaged in a possible explosion in Lacey, Washington. The local police department is investigating the incident, along with the FBI, which has been probing a number of acts of vandalism involving Tesla.\nThe Lacey Police Department said it received multiple calls of a “loud noise” at 1:34am PT, which could be a possible explosion. Officers arrived at a Target on Sleater Kinney Road to discover the damaged Tesla Supercharger station. Police said they are investigating the incident as “malicious mischief,” which describes the intentional damaging of someone’s property, and encourage anyone with information to reach out to the FBI.\nTesla’s Supercharger account on X said the company was “on site” with law enforcement, reviewing camera footage and coordinating with the local utility Puget Sound Energy. “Don’t mess with critical infrastructure,” the account added.\nIt’s the latest incident of Tesla-related vandalism, following CEO Elon Musk’s high-profile position in the Trump administration as the head of the Department of Government Efficiency. For weeks, Musk and DOGE have run roughshod through the federal government, cancelling humanitarian aid programs, slashing scientific research spending, and firing federal workers. His actions have led to a nationwide protest movement called Tesla Takedown, which aims to boycott the company’s vehicles and hurt its stock price. Last month, tens of thousands of people protested the company’s retail locations across the country.\nUnrelatedly, a number of vandalism incidents targeting Tesla has cropped up. Tesla vehicles have been set on fire or defaced, showrooms have been shot up, and charging stations have been destroyed. President Donald Trump has called the incidents “domestic terrorism,” and the FBI has created a task force to investigate the attacks.\n5 Comments5 New",
        "Tesla has a new entry-level Cybertruck with longer range, and it’s the cheapest model yet at $69,990 before the federal $7,500 credit. Tesla pulled some significant features to achieve the price cut.\nThe new “long range” Cybertruck has just a single RWD motor compared to the two in the AWD model. It also lacks a powered roll-up hard tonneau cover. You can either keep the bed open or buy a $750 fitted soft tonneau cover. As a consolation prize for less storage security, the cover apparently gives you an aerodynamic range boost of 12 miles, according to Tesla.\nThe Cybertruck Long Range can drive up to 350 miles on a charge, 25 miles more than the AWD model, or up to 362 miles with the soft tonneau cover. Towing capacity is also lower at 7,500 lbs compared to 11,000 lbs on the other trims.\nIt accelerates slower than the AWD model. The RWD Cybertruck goes 0-60mph in 6.2 seconds versus 4.1 seconds on the more expensive Cybertruck. Tesla removed adaptive suspension and the 120V and 240V power outlets from the RWD model, so it can’t power your tools on the go. The company also removed the battery range extender option this week.\nThe interior of the Cybertruck RWD comes with textile seats instead of the leatherette ones in the other models, and you aren’t getting the rear seat infotainment touchscreen, either.\nAt the company’s 2023 delivery event, Tesla said its RWD option had a lower advertised range of 250 miles and would cost $60,990. That version was never released, though. In 2024, the RWD base option was removed. The new, more expensive, RWD model is available for order in the US, Mexico, and Saudi Arabia.\nTesla has had trouble selling Cybertrucks, reportedly selling only 50,000 units in 2024 on apparently one million reservations. The company is also seeing a 13 percent drop in vehicle sales year over year, which can be partly attributed to CEO Elon Musk’s control of the “Department of Government Efficiency” in the Trump Administration.\n34 Comments34 New",

He spent over 15 years in IT support before joining The Verge.\nTesla has shared new images of its first retro drive-in restaurant location in Los Angeles.\nThe company’s CEO Elon Musk dreamt up the idea of a 1950s-themed “Tesla Diner” and Supercharger hub, complete with employees on rollerskates, as far back as 2018. More recently, Musk described it as a “Grease meets Jetsons with Supercharging,” as reported by The New York Times.\nImage: Tesla\nLast week, The Real Deal reported that Tesla is nearing completion with the diner located on Santa Monica Boulevard. It features two floors, rooftop seating, a bar, two drive-up movie screens, and 30 Supercharger stalls.\nTesla got the permit for the diner seven years ago. At the time, California was the de facto home of Tesla and a champion of its electric vehicles, but since then, the company has moved its headquarters to Texas, Musk has gotten into far-right politics with his deep involvement in the Trump Administration, and revenue is tanking as seen in today’s earnings report.\n13 Comments13 New\nSee More:\nCars\nElectric Cars\nNews\nTesla\nTranspo\nMost Popular\nMost Popular\nBethesda officially reveals Oblivion Remastered, available today\nT-Mobile is shuffling its high-end plans\nOpenAI tells judge it would buy Chrome from Google\nSony shows off the PS5 Pro’s liquid metal updates\nInstaller\nA weekly newsletter by David Pierce designed to tell you everything you need to download, watch, read, listen to, and explore that fits in The Verge’s universe.",
        "Tesla reported lower than expected earnings on Tuesday, with first-quarter profits dropping 71% on much lower sales of electric vehicles. The news isn’t altogether surprising, given the fact that Tesla CEO Elon Musk is the public face of the company and continues to help President Donald Trump destroy the U.S. federal government while peddling far-right extremism on his social media platform X.\nMusk tried to put a slightly rosier spin on the state of his EV company in an earnings call Tuesday, but he still sounded very depressed. The billionaire’s tone was subdued as he emphasized the autonomous taxi rides that he would be launching in Texas this June wouldn’t be the Cybercab vehicles many people on social media had expected. The company will only be operating Tesla Model Ys to pick up passengers, deflating news for some who had hoped Musk might deliver something unique.\nTesla reported $19.3 billion in revenue in the first quarter, down 9% compared with the same period a year earlier. The company produced 362,000 vehicles and delivered over 336,000. Deliveries of Tesla’s Model 3 and Model Y were down 12%. While the company doesn’t break out official figures for the Cybertruck, the product bucket that includes that truck was down 24%, perhaps because it’s the vehicle most associated with Musk’s brand of fascism.\nThe Cybertruck started deliveries in late 2023, after Musk had begun expressing racist and antisemitic ideas. Consumers likely assume anyone with a Cybertruck is fully on board with Musk’s agenda, while owners of Model 3 and Model Y vehicles are given a bit more leeway since the cars predate the billionaire oligarch unmasking himself as an overt villain.\nTesla reported adjusted earnings-per-share of 27 cents, far lower than expectations from analysts of 41 cents. The only bright spot in the company’s numbers were the $595 million in revenue brought in from carbon credits, the money paid by car companies making traditional gas-powered vehicles to offset the pollution they generate. Without those carbon credits, Tesla would’ve posted an operating loss for the quarter.\nAs the Wall Street Journal notes, Tesla is facing a future of high tariffs if President Trump’s ridiculously high taxes on imported goods remain. The cars that Tesla sells in the U.S. are manufactured in California and Texas, but many of the parts are imported from other countries and hit with 25% tariffs. Musk has been outspoken against tariffs and stressed on Tuesday’s earnings call that he was “one of many advisors to the president, I’m not the president.”\nMusk often tries to distract from bad news with splashy announcements. As one example, Reuters reported back in April 2024 that Tesla was planning to pivot away from producing a cheaper, long-anticipated $25,000 vehicle. After that report came out, Musk rushed out an announcement that he would produce a robotaxi, an event that was delayed from that summer to the fall of 2024. The actual unveiling was underwhelming to say the least, with some highly deceptive magic tricks, and Musk continues to promise big things about his Cybercab while we all wait. Musk insisted Tuesday that there will be fully autonomous taxi rides in Austin, Texas, by June, they just won’t be Cybercabs.\n“The Teslas that will be fully autonomous in June in Austin will be Model Ys, so that is currently on track to be able to do paid rides, fully autonomously in June, and then to be in many other cities in the U.S. by the end of this year,” Musk said on the call.\nMany people had previously taken his announcement about the Austin launch as a sign that he would be deploying the Cybercabs he announced back in October 2024. But it will take years and possibly decades for the Cybercab to become a reality at scale, if they ever do, according to most autonomous driving experts.\nMusk received a question from an analyst on the earnings call about details involving the kind of remote control that may be needed to operate his robotaxi service, but he seemed extremely reluctant to explain. “It’s only a couple months away. So you can just see for yourself in a couple months in Austin,” Musk said.\nThe earnings call on Tuesday was perhaps notable for having far less hype than usual. Yes, Musk tried to promise that his Optimus robots would be operating in Tesla factories by the end of 2025. And he made some other vague futuristic promises about full self-driving in the coming years. But Musk’s tone was noticeably downbeat and he didn’t have the same carnival-style salesmanship that often accompanies any public facing announcement for Tesla.\nTesla dealerships and showrooms have been the site of mass protests across the country since Musk launched DOGE, the so-called Department of Government Efficiency. There have also been cases of vandalism and arson, with some people facing federal terrorism charges brought by the U.S. Department of Justice. Musk insisted on the earnings call that protest against him are “very organized” and “paid for,” repeating suggestions he’s made previously about shadowy financiers who are supposedly funding demonstrations. Musk also said the “real reason” there are protests against him is that people who are receiving fraudulent money from government agencies that are now getting cut. Musk has never provided any evidence for this assertion.\nNotably, Musk said he would be stepping back from DOGE after May but didn’t go into any detail about what that would mean. Even though he said he would be easing up on his involvement, the billionaire said that he would remain in the government through President Trump’s entire term, which is only supposed to last four years. Trump has said repeatedly he’d like to stay in office beyond that, which would be flatly unconstitutional.\nIn his relatively short time in government, Musk has helped destroyed vital services and unlawfully abolished the United States Agency for International Development. DOGE has been credited with laying off over 280,000 people at 27 different government agencies, according to CBS News, and Musk has been particularly heartless to those people, insisting they should get “real jobs.”\nMusk and DOGE don’t actually have the legal authority to do almost any of this so-called cost-cutting, since Congress alone has the sole authority to create agencies, allocate funds, and take those funds away when it decides to do so. But that hasn’t stopped Musk, who seems to believe he can unilaterally cut anything he wants.\nIncredibly, DOGE is reportedly not even doing much to cut actual spending by the U.S. government, according to the New York Times. How could that be? Well, the vast majority of federal spending is on things like the U.S. military, Medicare, Medicaid, and Social Security. And while there has been some proposals to cut programs at the Pentagon, that’s money which will reportedly be spent on Trump’s pet projects like the Golden Dome missile defense program. Cuts to programs like Social Security have been relatively modest so far but they’re already causing longer wait times for seniors trying to get help over the phone. And there’s no telling what they’ll cut next after the congressional Republicans try to take their ax to Medicaid with their latest budget bill.\nMusk, along with Trump, has helped what the billionaire oligarch has repeatedly called a revolution. But it’s such an anti-human attack on anything good in America, that it’s no wonder consumers have decided maybe buying a Tesla isn’t for them.",
        "Andrew J. Hawkins is transportation editor with 10+ years of experience who covers EVs, public transportation, and aviation. His work has appeared in The New York Daily News and City & State.\nLast week, the US Department of Transportation announced a major change to the Biden-era rule that requires automakers and tech companies to report crashes that involve fully or partially autonomous vehicles. Under the revised rules, companies will no longer have to report certain crashes, such as those involving a vehicle equipped with a Level 2 advanced driver assist system (ADAS) that resulted in a tow-away, but no injuries, fatalities, or airbag deployments. The change was meant to, in Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy’s words, “slash red tape and move us closer to a single national standard that spurs innovation and prioritizes safety.”\nOne company that stands to benefit from the rule change is Tesla. Under the previous regime, Elon Musk’s company comprised the bulk of crashes reported to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) involving vehicles with Level 2 automated systems. But under the revised rule, Tesla’s load will be significantly lighter.\nTesla’s load will be significantly lighter\nUnder the previous rule, if a vehicle with a Level 2 driver assist system or above had a crash that resulted in the vehicle needing to be towed away, but didn’t involve a fatality, injury, any vulnerable road user like a pedestrian or cyclist, or an airbag deployment, it still needed to be reported to NHTSA. Now, under the revised rule, those specific tow-away crashes don’t need to be reported.\nAs the world’s foremost proponent of Level 2 automated systems, Tesla represents the majority of reported ADAS crashes. According to NHTSA, a total of 2,359 crashes involving vehicles equipped with ADAS were reported since the rule was first implemented in July 2021. Tesla reported 2,030 of those crashes, or approximately 86 percent, according to Advocates for Highway and Auto Safety.\nTo determine the number of fewer crashes that Tesla will need to report, the group searched the database for tow-away crashes, while filtering out non-Tesla vehicles and any crash involving an injury, fatality, vulnerable road user, and airbag deployment. Of Tesla’s 2,030 crashes, 240 met those criteria, which represents 12 percent of the company’s total reported crashes.\nThe idea behind the standing general order (SGO) was to create more transparency around the deployment of a new technology that purports to improve safety but has also been tied to a number of deadly incidents. Regulators argued that more data was needed to determine whether these new systems were making roads safer or simply making driving more convenient.\nTesla, in particular, came under scrutiny. The company’s Autopilot and Full Self-Driving features, which are considered Level 2 systems that require drivers to pay attention, are both covered under the rule. NHTSA has launched several investigations into Tesla’s driver-assist technology, most of which centered on crashes reported under the SGO.\nTesla reportedly despised the crash-notification requirement, believing that NHTSA presents the data in ways that mislead consumers about the automaker’s safety, two sources familiar with Tesla executives’ thinking told Reuters last December. Tesla CEO Elon Musk was one of Trump’s most vocal defenders during the campaign, spending at least $277 million of his own money to back his candidacy. And he now runs the Department of Government Efficiency with the goal of cutting government spending, eliminating humanitarian aid, and firing federal workers.\nDuring his confirmation hear, Secretary Duffy said he would allow safety investigations into Tesla’s advanced driving technology to proceed unimpeded. But a few months into the administration, Musk’s DOGE fired about 30 employees of NHTSA, many of them part of a department that assesses the risks of self-driving cars.\nSafety advocates say the rule revisions will hamper the public’s understanding of this evolving technology.\n“The less restrictive reporting requirements mean some crashes that don’t involve fatalities or serious injuries will no longer be collected by NHTSA as part of the SGO,” Michael Brooks, Executive Director at the Center for Auto Safety, said in a statement. “While these crashes may be of a lower severity, they could be very important in early identification of safety performance concerns with Level 2+ ADAS features.”\nUpdate April 29th: Updated to include a statement from Michael Brooks, executive director at the Center for Auto Safety.\n15 Comments15 New\nSee More:\nUncategorized\nMost Popular\nMost Popular\nNew Starlink subscription drops hardware price to $0\nDuolingo will replace contract workers with AI\nSlate Auto confirms where it’ll build its $20,000 Truck\nThe DJI Phantom is no more\nInstaller\nA weekly newsletter by David Pierce designed to tell you everything you need to download, watch, read, listen to, and explore that fits in The Verge’s universe.",

Many are from the 2024 model year and include limited “Foundation Series” Cybertrucks that ended production in October, plus some lightly used “demo” ones we saw that have racked up around 300 miles on the odometer.\nSome Cybertruck models in stock won’t be eligible for the $7,500 federal tax credit either due to their age or because the sticker price is too high. But as of this writing, interested buyers could get more than that with the available discounts, including as much as a $11,990 cut off a top Cyberbeast model that usually sells for $119,990. In January, the company offered up to $2,600 off inventory Cybertrucks.\nScreenshot: The Verge\nUsed Cybertruck prices are also taking a hit. CarGurus currently shows the average used Cybertruck selling for about $85,000, a steep drop from $104,300 on December 30th and $107,800 from November.\nBusiness Insider reports Tesla is also slowing down Cybertruck manufacturing at its Texas factory and shrinking its production teams. Some line workers are being moved over to build better-selling Model Y vehicles, but it, too, has seen a year-over-year decline in sales as reported by the company earlier this month.\n18 Comments18 New",

Kia will also include the port on the upcoming 2026 EV9 three-row SUV.\nOwners of current EV6, EV9, and Niro EV models can use a CCS1-to-NACS adapter, which can be purchased from Kia dealers. Meanwhile, Kia’s sister company Hyundai was granted Supercharger access in December, and owners of the Ioniq 5 and Ioniq 6 were offered free adapters, too.\nKia owners can navigate to Tesla Superchargers and check the locations’ statuses on their vehicle infotainment screens. They can also use the Kia Access app to start a session or enroll in Kia’s Charge Pass program.\nSome Kia EV6 and EV9 owners have previously tricked Superchargers into charging their EVs by telling the Tesla app that they are driving a Hyundai Ioniq 5 (both automakers share the same EV platform). But now, Kia can officially join the Tesla Supercharger access club that includes Ford, GM, Rivian, Hyundai, Kia, Mercedes-Benz, Volvo, and Polestar, Lucid, and soon, Honda.\n7 Comments7 New",
        "A Tesla whistleblower who has fought Elon Musk and his company through the courts for years has won the latest round of a long-running legal battle.\nEngineer Cristina Balan lost her job after she raised a safety concern in 2014 about a design flaw which could affect the cars' braking.\nHer defamation claim against the firm seemed to have run out of road when a judge confirmed an arbitration decision dismissing her case - but a panel of appeal judges in California has reversed this decision in her favour.\nShe told BBC News she now wants to face Elon Musk and Tesla in open court.\nTesla has not responded to a request for comment.\nMs Balan said she believes the case will now in effect go back to square one, and new proceedings can be launched.\n\"We are hoping we will start a new lawsuit and we will have the chance to take on Elon Musk in front of a jury and judge,\" she said.\nThe engineer was once so prominent at Tesla that her initials were engraved on the batteries inside Model S vehicles.\nIn an interview with BBC News last year, she said she is determined to prove her innocence for the sake of her son.\nShe also revealed she was in remission from stage-3B breast cancer, and her biggest worry was she may not live to see her final day in court.\nMs Balan claimed she was worried the carpets were curling underneath some pedals in Tesla models, creating a safety hazard.\nShe said managers rebuffed her concerns, became hostile, and she lost her job.\nShe then won a wrongful dismissal case - but this turned out to be the start of a long journey through the courts.\nMs Balan was publicly accused by Tesla of using its resources for a \"secret project\" - accusations which amount to embezzlement, a crime under US law.\nShe has consistently denied the accusation, and decided to bring a defamation case against the firm in 2019.\n\"I want to clear my name,\" she told BBC News last year.\n\"I wish Elon Musk had the decency to apologise.\"\nA court then decided Ms Balan's case should be subject to arbitration per a contract she signed while working for Tesla.\nThe arbitrator found in favour of the firm and Musk, dismissing her claims, due to California's statute of limitations - meaning too much time had passed since the alleged defamatory statements were made.\nTesla brought the case back to a district court in California to have the decision confirmed.\nHowever, Ms Balan appealed this decision, and judges from the US Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit found in her favour - in effect deciding the California court did not have the jurisdiction to make its judgement.\nThey have ordered for the confirmation of the arbitration award to be cancelled, and for the district court to dismiss the action due to its lack of jurisdiction.\nWhat could happen next?\nThe majority of legal experts the BBC has spoken to believe the case has some way to go before there will be any conclusion.\n\"Tesla is among the many corporations that force employees and customers into opaque arbitration processes and deploy aggressive strategies to retaliate against employees who voice criticism of corporate practices,\" said Stanford professor Anat Admati.\nAnd Bill Moran, Ms Balan's attorney, agreed the legal process is far from over.\nBut he said the case was \"revived\" by the latest ruling.\n\"We are confident we can secure her either a new arbitration or alternatively a trial in court so that her case can be heard on the merits after so many years,\" he said.\n\"She has fought cancer while waging this case... she is the epitome of strength and resolve, and she is now one step closer to getting the justice she deserves.\"\nAdditional reporting by Lily Jamali",
        "Tesla just announced its results for the first three months of 2025, and they represent the steepest sales decline in company history. Deliveries fell by 50,000 vehicles, to 336,681 cars, down 13% from the same period last year. It was Tesla’s worst quarter since 2022.\nMost analysts were expecting a large sales decline, in part because numbers coming out of Europe have not been good, and because Tesla temporarily closed some factories to update production lines for the new Model Y. There exists a wishful belief that some buyers held off while they waited for the new version of its most popular car to become available.\nOn social media, users report that the updated Model Y vehicles quickly became available at the start of March. And on Tuesday, Electrek reported that Tesla currently has $200 million worth of Cybertrucks sitting unsold in its inventory. The “other vehicles” category, which includes Model S, X, and Cybertruck (and perhaps the long forgotten Semi), was down 12,000 vehicles over the period last year. Which is to say, Tesla’s truly newest vehicle since the Model Y appears dead on arrival.\nIt is hard not to overlook the broader problems facing Tesla, namely the intense politicization of the brand under Elon Musk and fierce competition from rivals.\nPolls in recent months have shown that the majority of Americans do not seem to like Musk’s polarizing brand of politics. But worldwide protests, including vandalism, could have told you that. The traditional buyers of electric cars, eco-conscious liberals, are turned off by his right-wing views and alignment with President Trump. And while conservatives may appreciate his major backing of the Republican party, his cartoonish antics can be grating. MAGA supporters can espouse their views by purchasing a large pickup truck that will not get them bullied or ostracized by half the country. They do not need to buy an electric car to signal their values.\nOn Tuesday, Musk suffered a political setback in Wisconsin after his choice in a Supreme Court election there lost to liberal judge Susan Crawford. Musk spent $26 million on the race with support from President Trump in hopes of flipping the liberal majority. Even though Wisconsin chose Trump in the presidential election, sentiment suggests voters there do not like Musk’s slashing of the federal government or attempts to buy local elections.\nOn the competition front, China’s BYD is outselling Tesla once again, with sales of 416,000 electric vehicles in the first quarter. The company has managed to run circles around Tesla in its second-largest market, offering affordable cars with impressive performance including high-speed charging and free self-driving functionality—all while opening factories around the world. Meanwhile, Tesla’s line of vehicles is stale—in a market like China that is not great, as buyers demand newness. Sales of China-made Tesla’s fell 11% in the quarter.\nBut no matter, Tesla is a robotics and artificial intelligence company now. That is why its market valuation of $800 billion far exceeds other automakers that sell many more vehicles like Toyota and Ford. Tesla claims it is going to create robots that can replace humans on factory lines, and all the cars on the road today are going to be replaced by autonomous Cybercabs.\nEven there, a robot marathon in Beijing suggests Tesla’s Optimus robot prototype is behind Chinese competitors that appear much more agile.\nThe key question, if you believe Musk’s next act for Tesla is not in vehicles but futuristic robotics, is how does it get there if its prime moneymaker, selling cars, dries up? Tesla was a front-runner in the electric vehicle space, but its moat has all but evaporated while its CEO is distracted by politics and tarnishing the brand. Musk is more closely involved in politics than any CEO in recent memory, and it is clear there is a reason why other company leaders shy away from it.\nTesla has more than $30 billion in cash to help it fund investments, and sales could rebound in the coming quarters if consumers become fatigued by protests. Earlier backlash against companies like Bud Light and Target typically did not last very long. Ultimately, what most car buyers care about is value. Tariffs imposed by President Trump could benefit Tesla too, as the company manufacturers its cars for the U.S. market domestically.\nBut waiting could only metastasize the problem if it does not improve, and from a fundamental business perspective it is clearer than ever that Tesla is not the special company it once was. It is sad in a sense—it did not have to be this way. Tesla’s wounds are wholly self-inflicted.\nNot all may be lost, though—there have been rumors circulating on Wednesday that Musk may leave his role with DOGE soon. Maybe the backlash is getting to him.",
        "In 2021, when the Democrat-controlled Congress and the Biden administration were attempting to set up a new domestic terrorism program, human rights groups—ones that had typically fretted over the rightwing militia groups that the program was designed to combat—were the first to express dismay. “We write to express our deep concern regarding proposed expansion of terrorism-related legal authority,” wrote 157 different signatories, in a letter to Congress. “We must meet the challenge of addressing white nationalist and far-right militia violence without causing further harm to communities already disproportionately impacted by the criminal-legal system.” Meanwhile, a swell of CIA and national security officials eagerly urged the government to create new legal authorities to treat Americans like terrorists.\nNow, as Trump’s second term gets underway, the new rightwing government appears to be using the legal and operational infrastructure set up during the Biden years to go after leftwing protesters. Independent journalist Ken Klippenstein is out with a new article on the Trump administration’s blossoming counterterrorism strategy, which, according to government insiders, is poised to target Americans who express discontent about the president or his wealthy allies.\n“So-called Tesla terrorism and potential anti-Trump violence is driving new articulations of the threat,” a senior intelligence official told Klippenstein.\nIndeed, in recent weeks, the Justice Department has pivoted federal law enforcement away from more traditional enemies and towards people who vandalize Tesla dealerships. Several people arrested and accused of having firebombed the cars will likely be charged with “domestic terrorism” charges, Attorney General Pam Bondi has said. Meanwhile, critics of Israel have also become a target for the government’s roving eye.\nAs previously noted, the precedent for much of this was set by the previous administration. Under Biden, the government developed its first National Strategy to counter “domestic terrorism.” The strategy, which was designed with input from America’s national security agencies, set up a broad variety of new programs to counter what it perceived as extremism in the homeland, including new task forces and liaisons with state and local law enforcement.\nHowever, as Klippenstein points out, the full scale of the program is not publicly known. He points to a recently published Government Accountability Office (GAO) report on America’s counterterrorism strategy that notes “officials from DHS, DOJ, and State told us that the classified implementation plan includes some additional guidance for classified activities” and that “DHS and DOJ officials told us that they conduct additional activities to respond to the 2021 Strategy that are classified.” In other words: a secret program that spies on Americans and treats them like terrorists is not available for public consumption.\nThat secret program is now being helmed by the Trump administration, which has very different ideas about who and what poses a danger to this country than its predecessor. The administration is busy revising the strategy to better suit Trump’s needs. Klippenstein writes:\n…the rewrite of the National Strategy document is shaping up to comport with Trump’s view of the country, the GAO hints and others say, rescinding the previous approach and altering the focus of counterterrorism actions over the next four years. That includes focusing more on Trump’s political opponents and framing petty crimes taking place at day-to-day protests as terrorism.\nWorse still, the head of America’s counterterrorism strategy, Sebastian Gorka, is described as an Israel-loving gun nut who is fond of “secret operations” and “special operators.” Gorka is tasked with overseeing all of America’s counterterrorism operations—both international and domestic.\nKlippenstein quotes from a federal counterterrorism manual published in 2021 that lists various so-called “mobilization indicators.” These indicators, he writes, are considered “characteristics that could move people to carry out acts of extremist violence.” Under the government’s domestic counterterrorism mandate, Americans who demonstrate such indicators could find themselves the subject of a suspected terrorism probe—even if they have never committed a crime. Klippenstein writes:\nEver had a heated argument expressing sympathy for Luigi Mangione or HAMAS? Or bought military-style tactical equipment? Or withdrawn from family? If so, you meet the government’s criteria listed in its 2021 “Mobilization Indicators” booklet, a document intended to help local and state police to spot a terrorist. These criteria might strike you as creepy because, as the booklet itself concedes, “many of the mobilization indicators included in this booklet may also relate to constitutionally protected activities.”\nIn short, if you’ve ever been a super-vocal critic of the current administration or its allies, you could end up being a target of the government’s national security state.\nLots of people—myself included—saw this coming. In 2021, when the Biden administration began pushing for a new domestic terrorism program, I thought it was a really, really bad idea. At the time, I wrote:\nFor all the wailing and gnashing of teeth the Democrats did about Trump’s authoritarian style, it seems deeply ironic that they would kick off this new moment of party ascendance by pushing for such overwhelming new powers for the nation’s security agencies. Such proposals seem destined to do little except further disfigure the already mutilated corpus of civil liberties that Americans used to take such pride in—but which they now ever more sleepily deride as outdated, impractical, and unsafe.\nNow, here we are, some four years later, and a program that offers the government way too much power could easily be weaponized against peaceful political protesters. It’s not a happy time, though perhaps Americans might learn something from it.",
        "Tesla is facing the consequences of President Trump’s tariff strategy. While the company’s U.S. business is somewhat cushioned from import tariffs because it is more vertically integrated than other carmakers, Tesla’s business abroad faces retaliatory tariffs on imports of its cars.\nBloomberg first reported that Tesla has stopped taking orders for its high-end Model S and Model X vehicles in China because the company imports those into the market. Tesla produces the more affordable Model 3 and Model Y vehicles in China at its Shanghai Gigafactory, meaning they are not impacted by that country’s 125% tariffs implemented in the ongoing tit-for-tat trade war.\nFortunately for Tesla, the Model S and Model X are some of its least-popular vehicles by a wide mile, so the loss of sales of those in China may not have a material impact. It is still offering S and X vehicles that are already in inventory in the country.\nBeing so close to President Trump has been something of a double-edged sword for CEO Elon Musk. While he appears to be lining up lucrative contracts for his empire of businesses, Musk’s global reach makes him highly exposed to geopolitical feuds and an easy target in scuffles with adversaries.\nMusk has been surprisingly forthright in his disdain for Trump’s tariff strategy. After top trade adviser Peter Navarro claimed Musk dislikes tariffs because he imports many parts, Musk shot back, saying Tesla’s are the most American-built vehicles and calling Navarro “dumber than a sack of bricks” before sarcastically apologizing to bricks. Musk also began posting videos of economists outlining the benefits of free trade—such as the obvious fact that certain key materials like rare earth metals can not be sourced in the United States, or would be hard to mine. But President Trump believes in a zero-sum fallacy that in any transaction with foreign countries, one person winning means the other loses.\nPresident Trump has been pro-tariff and anti-trade for decades, so this is something of a get-what-you-paid-for scenario. And while it can be argued that certain key products should be manufactured in the United States, like semiconductors for computers, critics of tariffs say they should be brought back using incentives, like the CHIPS Act, rather than through broad tariffs that harm Americans, especially those with lower incomes who cannot easily afford to absorb higher prices. Factories, even if they do come back to America, take a long time to build and develop the manufacturing skill of Asian competitors. Some economists are sounding the alarm that America is about to head into a recession.\nCommodity products, should they be made in the U.S., would likely be too expensive to compete globally, and with all the policy flip-flopping brands are likely not interested in committing to domestic factories. Ironically, the tariff war only makes opening factories abroad a better idea, as manufacturers would be able to avoid Trump’s import tax.\nThe United States is the largest economy in the world that has had a largely comfortable last 60 years of growth on the back of exporting services like social media apps and Hollywood entertainment, not making tennis shoes. Though there is a concern that the U.S. relying on cheap labor abroad is exploitative and immoral, the reality is Americans are not likely to want to perform labor-intensive jobs. Asian markets have become extremely adept at manufacturing, while America does the design and innovation.\nRetaliatory tariffs like those we are seeing today further highlight how barriers put up to protect domestic industry can hurt American companies on the world stage—the European Union is already looking at allowing more Chinese electric vehicles into its market, potentially unseating American automakers.\nPresident Trump has also said that the U.S. needs to implement tariffs on foreign goods to reduce the country’s spending deficit and stave off some future debt crisis. Economists say the government could take other steps to balance the books, and conversely, the trade war has caused foreign countries to dump U.S. federal bonds, raising the yield made on government loans and therefore making it less attractive to invest in risky businesses.\nOther tech companies with leaders who have supported Trump are also facing risks from fighting with China. Amazon’s marketplace, for instance, is full of products from China, and Meta derives tens of billions in revenue from sellers in China posting ads across its social networks. Apple, which still makes most of its iPhone’s in China, has seen its stock fall 20% so far this year as it may soon need to raise prices. One analyst has predicted that an iPhone manufactured in the United States would cost $3,500.",
        "The early days of Elon Musk’s time at the Department of Government Efficiency were defined by big, flashy actions, promises of massive cuts, and dubious legality. As his 130-day cutoff as a limited government employee approaches, it seems he’ll be leaving with a thud. On top of significantly cutting the expected “savings” that his pseudo-agency will produce, other signature policies like the “5 things” email that went out at the start of DOGE’s operation have fallen entirely by the wayside, according to the Washington Post.\nMusk and his team of large toddlers at DOGE made waves back in February when they sent an email with the subject line “What did you do last week?” to every government employee, demanding they list five accomplishments that had been made over the previous week or face termination for failing to respond. That never came to fruition and, according to the Washington Post, was never even a real threat. Almost immediately, the Office of Personnel Management told agencies the initiative was voluntary and noncompliance would not result in resignation. The agency also never did anything with the emails it received.\nAs tends to happen with feckless policies, people started ignoring the emails altogether. Per the Post, some agencies still require responses to the emails, which have apparently continued months later, but others have stopped mandating responses and don’t check which employees have replied or not. And, most notably, there does not appear to have been any consequences for the mix of responses (or non-responses).\nDOGE has become a microcosm of how most Musk-led operations tend to go. Not only did it take weeks for the agency to reveal who was allegedly at the helm, but the lack of any real leadership has resulted in chaos basically every step of the way. The department has run on the Silicon Valley standard of “move fast and break things,” and has definitely accomplished the latter, resulting in a litany of legal challenges along the way. Meanwhile, Musk’s big pledge of cutting $2 trillion in federal spending has been revised down to $1 trillion and now $150 billion—all while the cuts that have been made have failed to make any actual dent in the deficit. A classic Muskian “over promise and under deliver” move.\nMusk’s exit might serve his interests, at least as it relates to his association with the federal government. Per the Washington Post, people close to him say he’s sick of getting attacked for his role at DOGE. Plus, he clearly would like to distance himself from the Trump tariff regime and has been attacking some of the people behind the policy. So the timing of his departure seems right.\nAssuming Musk actually does ditch DOGE (this administration has not been big on following federal laws, after all), he’ll be leaving his new mess for an old one. Tesla is staring down a potential crisis, in no small part because of how badly Musk’s behavior has damaged the brand.\nThe company’s stock is already showing some negative markers heading into an earnings call on Tuesday, and Bloomberg reports that even the bulls are starting to sound the alarm. Wedbush Securities analyst Dan Ives called for Musk to leave DOGE and return to Tesla, which he believes is facing a “code red” moment as Tesla sales slump and production of cheaper models has hit snags. Currently, Tesla’s biggest promises are a network of robotaxis and a humanoid robot, both of which are dubious at best. Tuesday will show just how much stomach investors have for Musk’s bad press and how much faith they’re willing to place in the CEO’s standard practice of making a big promise years in the future to keep the shell game going.",
        "Tesla reported a weaker-than-expected first quarter, missing its revenue target by nearly $2 billion.\nElon Musk said he will step back from his role with DOGE, staying involved part time.\nThe company also unveiled a new timeline for robotaxis and details on its more affordable model.\nTesla came up short in its first-quarter earnings on Tuesday, missing Wall Street's estimates amid a slump in sales and looming uncertainty in the auto industry.\nThe EV giant used its Tuesday call to share key updates that address some of investors' concerns hanging over a particularly weak quarter.\nFor instance, Tesla CEO Elon Musk said that he would be stepping back from his role with the White House DOGE office and answered questions about how tariffs would impact Tesla.\nMusk also unveiled new details on the much-anticipated \"more affordable\" Tesla model, as well as new timelines on the company's robotaxi rollout.\nHere are the five biggest takeaways from Tesla's call and how analysts are taking it:\n1. Musk said he'll be stepping back from DOGE\nMusk said Tuesday he plans to significantly scale back his involvement in the White House DOGE office to refocus on Tesla.\n\"Starting next month, I will be allocating far more of my time to Tesla,\" he said, adding that \"the major work of establishing the Department of Government Efficiency is done.\"\nHe said he'll continue to spend a day or two a week on government matters, for as long as President Donald Trump wants him to.\nMusk did not directly address how his involvement with DOGE may have damaged Tesla's brand. The company's chief financial officer, Vaibhav Taneja, said that vandalism and anti-Tesla hostility \"had an impact in certain markets.\"\n2. New details on the robotaxi rollout\nTesla is set to debut its long-anticipated robotaxi service in Austin this June, starting with \"maybe 10 to 20 vehicles,\" Musk said.\nRelated stories\nBusiness Insider tells the innovative stories you want to know\nBusiness Insider tells the innovative stories you want to know\n\"We want to make sure that we're paying very close attention,\" said Musk, adding that operations will \"scale up rapidly after that.\"\nTesla also confirmed on the call that the initial launch will include remote human operators who can intervene if a vehicle becomes stuck or encounters an issue.\nMusk said the goal is to bring the service to \"many other cities in the US by the end of this year,\" predicting that \"there will be millions of Teslas operating fully autonomously in the second half of next year.\"\nIn a dig at Waymo, Musk said the autonomous driving competitor's cars cost \"'way mo' money,\" adding that he doesn't see competition for Tesla at present in this field.\n3. A more affordable Tesla model\nInvestors have long been pressing Tesla for an affordable model, which it has delayed. A more affordable car would mean a broader market of possible buyers.\n\"Plans for new vehicles, including more affordable models, remain on track for start of production in the first half of 2025,\" the company said. \"Given economic uncertainty resulting from changing trade policy, more affordable options are as critical as ever.\"\nLars Moravy, the vice president of vehicle engineering, said during the call that it \"doesn't make bad cars,\" and that the goal is to produce a vehicle that's no worse than the cars it has previously released.\n\"The key is affordable,\" said Moravy.\n4. Tesla says it's more insulated from tariffs\nMusk said that Tesla would be \"the least affected car company\" when it comes to tariffs.\n\"With respect to supply chain risk, something that Tesla has been working on for several years, is to localize supply chains,\" Musk said. \"Tariffs are still tough on a company when margins are still low, but we do have localized supply chains in both America, Europe, and China, so that puts us in a stronger position than any of our competitors.\"\nMusk also said that he does not support high tariffs and has told Trump his take on tariffs.\n\"I'm an advocate of predictable tariff structures, and generally, I'm an advocate for, you know, pro-trade and lower tariffs,\" said Musk.\nAnalysts are monitoring how tariffs affect automakers and their suppliers. Yun Mei, an EV analyst with wealth manager China Great Wall Securities, said on Bloomberg TV on Wednesday that suppliers have little room for price changes because the market is highly competitive.\nIf tariffs increase \"too much, there is no room for Tesla or its suppliers to survive,\" she said.\n5. Tesla ticks up in after-hours trading\nIn after-hours trading, Tesla stock ticked up more than 5%.\nCraig Irwin, a senior research analyst at Roth Capital Partners, told Business Insider before the earnings call that Tesla needs to emphasize its on-track production for the affordable model and its robotaxis.\n\"The conversation there is what's going to drive the stock,\" said Irwin.\nMei, the China Great Wall analyst, said the call gave her \"strong faith\" in Tesla's sales recovery. But any further sales declines, coupled with tariffs, could make the company's margin \"very ugly,\" she said on Bloomberg TV.\nIn a Tuesday night note, Cantor Fitzgerald analysts maintained their expectation that Tesla stock's total return could exceed 15% over the next year.\nThe analysts also said that Tesla's risks include regulatory approval for its robotaxi, a slowdown of EV demand, and the removal of the EV tax credit.\nTesla\nElon Musk\nRead next",
        "​Morgan Stanley's long-time relationship with Tesla CEO Elon Musk is paying off.\nThe investment bank on Friday posted net income of $4.3 billion in the first quarter, up 26% over last year, surpassing analysts' forecasts. The bank's $17.7 billion in quarterly revenue was boosted by a 45% increase in its equity trading business, whose revenue soared to a record $4.1 billion amid heightened market volatility.\nThe bank also saw a jump in \"other\" revenue in its institutional securities group. That line includes the bank's corporate loan book, which benefited from the sale of loans the bank raised in 2022 to help Musk buy the social media platform now called X, according to a person with knowledge of the company's finances.\nMorgan Stanley led a group of seven banks in raising $13 billion in debt for the 2022 buyout.\nBloomberg first reported that the boost in the \"other\" category was tied to the sale of the X loans.\nMorgan Stanley has long been a banker to Musk. The firm's star tech banker, Michael Grimes, recently left Morgan Stanley after 30 years for a role with the Commerce Department, which is headed by Howard Lutnick, who also hails from Wall Street.\nGrimes played an important role in helping the Tesla CEO buy X, then called Twitter, in 2022. The deal ended up costing Morgan Stanley and the other lending banks billions in so-called hung loans, or debt that banks are having trouble offloading to investors.\nMorgan Stanley and other banks began selling the debt this year amid a brightened financial picture for X, according to a person with knowledge of the sales.\nOn Friday, Morgan Stanley CEO Ted Pick said he is \"cautiously optimistic\" about the state of the economy, a stark contrast to comments made earlier on Friday by JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon.\n\"We have not seen a slowdown,\" Pick said, referring to market activity since the start of April. \"Is it bumpier for some clients? Of course, it is,\" he said, adding, \"But we are still, we'll call it, cautiously optimistic that we won't go into recession, and we will just keep going.\"",
        "The Telsa Cybertruck is thrilling to many younger kids — it's a cool-looking weird big truck!\nThere are even songs and books for kids about Cybertrucks.\nAs Elon Musk and his cars become a political symbol, kids are blissfully unaware.\nThe Cybertruck has become a nexus point of public opinion about Elon Musk and DOGE, a 4-wheeled emblem of our divided country. Cybertrucks are being vandalized, and drivers are being flipped off. Owners who just thought it was a cool car are stuck with making some sort of political statement — whether they wanted to or not.\nFor kids, it's a different story. Kids love Cybertrucks.\nThis makes sense. First of all, kids love trucks! For a preschooler, passing by an active construction site is like being a VIP at Coachella.\nThe Cybertruck is big, it's distinctive. It's rare. Seeing one on the road or even in a parking lot is a head-turner. It looks like it was made in Minecraft or out of Legos. It's absolutely aesthetically thrilling for a demographic that can't yet tie shoes.\n\"My 6-year-old loves Teslas but has no idea who Musk is, and that's intentional,\" said Mandy Shobar, a parent of two boys in Castro Valley, California. Shobar herself is not a fan of Telsa's CEO for reasons that would make sense to other adults but not a kindergartener. Her older son, 9, is less excited about the Cybertruck. \"He says they look 'glitchy.'\"\nAround the Business Insider office, parents also noted their kids were obsessed with Cybertrucks. My boss's first grader recently brought home a piece of art from school dedicated to the EV.\nMy own kids get excited when they see a Cybertruck. My son went through a phase when he was around 6 or 7 when he was fascinated by Elon Musk as a character, and even brought home a book from the school library about Teslas. (The book, from 2018, didn't include too much about Musk himself.)\nRelated stories\nBusiness Insider tells the innovative stories you want to know\nBusiness Insider tells the innovative stories you want to know\nImagine this through a child's eyes: Elon Musk is the richest man in the world who makes rockets and cool-looking cars. How could you not be intrigued? Kids are obsessed with superlatives: the fastest, the biggest, the most. It's why everyone knows the blue whale is the biggest, and the cheetah is the fastest. Kids talk about Usain Bolt's speed with reverence and compare heights to the Burj Khalifa (which, to be honest, I only learned is the world's tallest building from my own kid).\nElon Musk is becoming less popular with adults\nMeanwhile, the idea that Musk is controversial because of his political opinions and role in DOGE is not really something that is easily explained to a small child.\nIt wasn't too many years ago that Musk seemed like an unproblematic aspirational STEM figure for young kids. But with his involvement in the 2024 election and now DOGE, the public's perception of Musk has changed. According to Nate Silver's The Silver Bulletin, Musk's favorability polling switched from positive to negative last summer, and he's now less popular than ever — with 53.5% \"unfavorable\" ratings.\nTom Cook (no relation to Tim) isn't some Tesla hater — he previously owned a Model 3. He thinks the Cybertruck, however, is aesthetically unpleasing. \"There are some technical aspects of it that are good (electrical components where Tesla does good engineering), but the nexus of cost/practicality/looks/association with [Musk] make it just impossible to ever take seriously,\" Cook told Business Insider.\nStill, he was surprised when his 3-year-old daughter made a piece of Cybertruck art.\nThere exists a world of Cybertruck paraphrenia for kids. Mattel's Hot Wheels makes a classic pocket-sized Cybertruck (my kids have one) and a larger die-cast light-up Cybertruck for about $20.\nOn Amazon and other online stores, you can find a variety of other remote-controlled Cybertruck-shaped toys from various no-name brands. (It is unclear if some of these actually have licensing deals with Tesla as Mattel does.)\nTesla sells a $1,500 battery-operated ride-on Cybertruck for kids, similar to Power Wheels. It can fit two kids, suggested age range of 6 to 12. Telsa also makes a \"Cyberquad\" for kids ages 9 to 12, which is an ATV-style ride-on toy, selling for $1,650.\nThere's even a world of media about Cybertrucks for kids. One person told me her 5-year-old truck-loving kid has discovered a song on YouTube Kids he plays on repeat. (I dare anyone to try to not tap your toes to this banger.)\nThere are non-fiction books for kids about the Cybertruck, not unlike the one on Telsa my son once brought home.\nThere's also a picture book, The Ugly Truckling: The Story of My Cybertruck.\" The Amazon summary reads:\nWhen a dad brings home a Cybertruck, his daughter is less than impressed. With its unconventional and futuristic appearance, the truck seems like an ugly duckling in a world of familiar cars. But as the little girl begins to learn more about the Cybertruck's capabilities and its potential to help the world, she begins to see it in a whole new light.\nFor the parents who find the Cybertruck to be a totem of something they disagree with politically, it may be slightly jarring to see their kids squeal with glee when they see one cruising down the street.\nBut there are lots of things that kids love that can make parents cringe: room-temperature apple juice, \"Baby Shark,\" the idea that being asked to put on shoes and coat in a timely manner is an affront to human dignity.\nNone of the parents I heard from who don't always share the same opinions about the Cybertruck put too much worry into it. To them, it was an amusing passing phase that reminded them of the vast gulf between how a child sees the world and how we see it.\nAdmittedly, I spend a lot of my day thinking about Elon Musk, and I wish I could have the free wonder to see a cool-looking car and just go, \"Wow!\"",

Hong/ AP Images\nAll it took was Tesla's profits to plunge 71%. On Tuesday, the carmaker delivered a dismal first-quarter earnings report. Revenue was down 9% year over year, and vehicle deliveries dropped 13%.\nThen came the earnings call and Musk's big announcement: \"Starting next month, I will be allocating far more of my time to Tesla.\"\nIt was the news Tesla investors had been waiting to hear. The company's stock jumped 5% in after-hours trading.\nAt DOGE, Musk helped President Donald Trump gut the federal workforce through buyout offers to government employees, mass firings of probationary workers, and dismantling agencies like USAID.\nAll the while, Tesla appears to have paid the price. Its stock declined 41% year to date, and the Cybertruck became a political target.\nBut what if Musk's renewed focus on Tesla is too little, too late?\nFollowing a report earlier this month that Musk could soon exit the White House, early Tesla backer Ross Gerber said that replacing Musk as CEO was one of the few ways the company could move forward: \"I think the damage is done.\"\nMusk's increased focus on Tesla wasn't the only announcement. We also got new details on the robotaxi rollout, a more affordable Tesla model, and a tariffs update. Here are BI's five big takeaways.\n3 things in markets\n1. Gold is proving to be the ultimate safe-haven investment. The precious metal touched a record-setting high of $3,506 midday Tuesday.

        "Wall Street analyst Dan Ives, long bullish on Tesla, has soured on the stock.\nIn a note published Sunday, Ives' firm, Wedbush Securities, slashed its 12-month price target for Tesla stock from $550 to $315, a 43% reduction — though still above its current price of $239.\n\"Tesla has essentially become a political symbol globally,\" the firm wrote. \"That is a very bad thing for the future of this disruptive tech stalwart and the brand crisis tornado that has now turned into an F5 tornado.\"\nIves says Musk's foray into politics hasn't been a great look for the carmaker. The firm estimates that Tesla has already lost 10% of its future global customer base — a conservative estimate — based on \"self-created brand issues.\"\nBrand issues aside, the firm said the biggest reason for the price target cut is the impact President Donald Trump's new tariffs will have on its trade relationship with China.\nTrump has collectively levied a 54% tariff on Chinese goods coming into the United States since taking office in January. China retaliated on Friday with its own 34% tariff on US goods.\nWhile Trump's tariffs may not significantly impact Tesla due to its large US manufacturing footprint, the company still relies on car parts from China, like batteries.\nThe political backlash to Trump and Musk in China, however, will likely affect Tesla's sales in the key EV market. Wedbush wrote that Chinese consumers are more likely to opt for domestic cars made by BYD, Nio, and Xpeng.\nThe firm also pointed to already evident examples of loss, including Tesla's delivery numbers for the first quarter of 2025, which came in at nearly 336,700, a 13% year-over-year decrease. \"This could be a brutal year ahead if Musk does not exit stage left or take a step back on DOGE in the coming month,\" Wedbush said.\nEven early Tesla investor Ross Gerber has bristled at Tesla's decline. \"The high-end EV business has totally eroded. The cybertruck is basically not selling. The brand is broken and may not be fixable,\" he wrote in a post on X last week.\nThe company's stock price has dropped almost 37% since the start of the year and over 50% from a record high on December 17, 2024.\nTesla did not immediately respond to a request for comment from Business Insider.",
        "Marketing experts say Elon Musk has alienated the eco-conscious customer base who would buy Teslas.\nMusk, as Tesla's face, has made its vehicles a \"negative luxury,\" a brand expert told BI.\nTesla could rebrand by removing Musk, changing its name, and scrapping its Cybertrucks.\nAs Tesla sees cratering sales and faltering investor confidence, marketing experts say CEO Elon Musk has repelled the precise political demographic mostly likely to buy his vehicles — and that the path to recovery may not be easy.\nAside from Musk selling his 13% stake in Tesla or ceasing his political activities, brand experts told Business Insider that it may be a good idea for Tesla to change its name and logo to leave its past behind — a practice common to airlines after major disasters.\n\"Tesla is more politically skewed than any other brand, and it is clearly skewed liberal,\" David J. Reibstein, Professor of Marketing at The Wharton School, told Business Insider, \"and they have successfully alienated themselves from their customer base.\"\nMusk has drawn public ire over his involvement with the White House DOGE office, which rapidly laid off tens of thousands of federal workers, endangered programs like Social Security, and imperiled conservation causes. The Environmental Protection Agency alone canceled more than 400 grants under DOGE.\n\"A lot of the people who were buying Teslas are those concerned about climate change. A lot of the Republicans don't believe in climate change, and so trying to get some of the Republicans to replace the Democrats as the customers is a big step forward,\" Reibstein added.\nNot only are Tesla showrooms worldwide regularly surrounded by protesters from the Tesla Takedown movement, but the company also reported a 13% drop in quarterly sales in the US between January and March compared to the same period in 2024. This marks Tesla's weakest performance since early 2022.\nIn Europe, Tesla lost more than 40% of its sales in January and February compared to the same two months last year.\nTesla blamed the slowdown on production line reconfigurations ahead of an anticipated Model Y refresh. Still, its stock price also suggests investors are concerned about Musk's commitment to the company, given his focus on DOGE.\nAs of the market closing on April 4, Tesla stocks had already lost about 36% of their value since the beginning of 2025. Vice President JD Vance said on Thursday that Musk's work in the White House \"is not even close to done\" and that he will remain a \"friend and adviser\" to the administration.\nThe danger of a one-face brand\nWhile there have been individual acts of vandalism against Tesla showrooms and cars, many Tesla Takedown organizers advocate for peaceful protests and focus the heat on Musk. To them, a boycott against Tesla cars is more of a tool to create pressure and financial damage for Musk than spray-painting Cybertrucks.\nRelated stories\nBusiness Insider tells the innovative stories you want to know\nBusiness Insider tells the innovative stories you want to know\nDan Ives, a Wedbush Securities analyst who has consistently been bullish about Tesla's long-term prospects, wrote in a joint note in March that the EV maker is \"going through a crisis\" and facing a \"defining chapter.\"\nHe added that he thinks Musk is the \"one person who can fix it\" and that the outcome depends on Musk.\nBranding experts have said that having a single individual represent a brand, like Musk represents Tesla, is at best a risk and at worst a liability.\n\"100% of the communication of Tesla today in Europe is created by the buzz around Musk,\" Jean-Noel Kapferer, an Emeritus professor of marketing at HEC Paris, told BI. Kapferer said Musk is making Tesla cars a \"negative luxury\" and leading some to call the company \"Tesmusk.\"\n\"A brand is built by customers, not companies,\" said Marty Neumeier, author and Director of CEO Branding for Liquid Agency. \"So when Musk appeared to change from a 'progressive genius' to an 'arrogant tyrant,' putting himself above the car and its customers, he changed the meaning of the brand.\"\nTaking a page from airline companies\nMarketing experts say it's not too late for Tesla to rebrand and bounce back, but most routes toward recovery may require significant concessions from Musk.\nLars Perner, an assistant professor of Clinical Marketing at the University of Southern California, told BI that the most obvious solution would be for Musk to sell his shares and allow someone less conspicuous to take over as CEO. This move could make Tesla \"worth considerably more\" without Musk's \"alienation of the core market.\"\nReibstein, the Wharton professor, said another solution would be for Tesla to change its name and logo — essentially taking a page from the playbook of airline companies that have experienced major accidents.\nFor example, after a 1996 ValuJet Airlines crash in Florida killed all 110 passengers on board, the company acquired AirTran Airways and simply took the new acquisition's name.\nCorporate Airlines became RegionsAir when a flight crashed in Missouri and resulted in 13 fatalities in October 2004.\nIn 2014, Malaysia Airlines considered renaming itself after it lost two planes — flight MH370, which disappeared over the Indian Ocean, and flight MH17, which was shot down over eastern Ukraine by pro-Russia separatists.\nRyanair, one of the world's largest airlines, renamed its Boeing 737 Max jets \"737-8200\" in 2019 after 2 fatal crashes spooked customers.\nReibstein said that one of the few examples he could think of when a brand so closely tied to a tarnished name bounced back without really distancing itself from its past was when Martha Stewart — eponymous to her home decor and culinary products empire — was convicted of lying to federal investigators.\n\"Everybody anticipated that was going to be the brand's demise when she went to jail,\" said Reibstein. \"But when she came back, somehow she's been able to rehabilitate the brand.\"\nAside from solutions that mainly hinge on Musk, Neumeier said that the Cybertruck, the stainless steel-clad vehicle that has already faced multiple recalls, also needs to go.\n\"To most customers, it looks like it came from another planet, and not a nice one,\" said Neumeier of Cybertrucks, \"It's now the de facto symbol of 'American fascism,' as some are calling Musk's vision for the future.\"\nTesla\nElon Musk\ncybertruck\nRead next",

        "Tesla's first-quarter delivery report showed the EV giant's business is in trouble.\nIndustry observers told BI what Tesla has to do to stay competitive.\nThey said more models, advanced tech, and advertising could be the answer.\nTesla just can't seem to catch a break.\nThe company's stock has fallen amid a backlash against CEO Elon Musk, and its latest delivery report on Wednesday showed its car sales business is fundamentally in trouble.\nThe company's Q1 deliveries dropped 13% from the previous year to just 336,700, well short of analysts' forecasts. Dan Ives, who's typically bullish on the automaker, called the figures \"a disaster\" that showed the automaker is in a \"full-blown crisis.\"\nBusiness Insider spoke to some of the auto industry's keenest observers about what the company needs to do to turn things around.\nLaunch more models\nWhile the political backlash against Musk has grabbed headlines, Sean Tucker, the lead editor for Kelley Blue Book, told BI that Tesla's aging product lineup could be a big reason deliveries were falling.\nHe said the carmaker has been grappling with a downward trend in delivery numbers since February 2023.\n\"They grew from 2020 to 2023, and then they started shrinking,\" Tucker said, citing data from Kelley Blue Book that found Tesla hit a peak of 60,325 monthly US sales in February 2023.\nThe automaker began selling a revamped version of its bestselling Model Y earlier this year but it hasn't launched a new vehicle since the Cybertruck in 2023.\nWhile the Cybertruck was the top-selling vehicle in the small EV truck market in 2024, the pickup has failed to boost Tesla's sales numbers. In the first quarter of this year, the company sold just 12,881 \"other models,\" which include the Cybertruck, Model S, and Model X.\nMichael Lenox, a business professor and an EV industry expert at the University of Virginia's Darden School of Business, told BI that European and Chinese manufacturers now have EV models that are \"eating into\" the lead Tesla once had.\n\"We've just seen massive entry by all the global existing incumbent auto manufacturers,\" he added.\nStephanie Valdez Streaty, the director of industry insights at Cox Automotive, told BI that the number of EVs on the US market had ballooned from around 19 in 2020 to 78.\nShe said that's made the launch of an affordable EV, which Tesla has said is set to go into production in the first half of 2025, even more crucial to the company.\n\"They need a new model that's affordable because affordability has been a huge issue for consumers,\" said Valdez Streaty.\nShe said that with average new vehicle prices in the US now close to $50,000 and tariffs set to raise prices even further, the time is ripe for Tesla to launch a mass-market EV — especially as the company's factories in the US could shield it somewhat from the tariffs.\n\"Tesla has said in the past that they are between two waves of growth, so they need something to propel them to that next growth wave,\" Valdez Streaty said.\nWhile some might consider an under-$30,000 vehicle Tesla's saving grace, Tucker said that the company hasn't indicated its affordable EV will necessarily be a high-volume product. He said it would likely be a new version of a Model 3 or Model Y with a smaller battery or different battery technology.\n\"That's not really a compelling high-volume product that's going to win them a bunch of sales, at least in the United States,\" Tucker said.\nRelease more advanced tech\nLenox said Tesla also needed to focus on \"pushing the technology forward so they can get more capacity and lower cost out of the battery.\"\nRelated stories\nBusiness Insider tells the innovative stories you want to know\nBusiness Insider tells the innovative stories you want to know\nLenox told BI that Tesla's Chinese competitor BYD not only has more models on the road but also dominates the battery value chain.

The 1,000-kilowatt chargers are four times as powerful as Tesla's current 250-kilowatt chargers, which Tesla has said can add 200 miles of range in 15 minutes. Tesla plans to roll out 500-kilowatt chargers this year, but that's still half the output BYD claims to be able to provide.\nTucker added that Tesla has \"nothing particularly exciting in the pipeline\" on the tech front. Teslas are built on a 400-volt system, and most rivals are now built on an 800-volt system, which allows for faster charging and better performance.\nWhile Tesla is due to launch its robotaxi service in Austin this summer, Tucker said that Tesla's rivals have already launched robotaxis — and struggled to make them profitable.\n\"Maybe Tesla has some secret sauce that it can make it work in a way that GM didn't,\" Tucker said. \"But even if it did, I don't know that anyone goes out and buys a Tesla because they enjoyed driving in Tesla's robotaxi.\"\nRamp up advertising\nTesla has traditionally been reluctant to advertise, preferring to rely on Elon Musk's social media and word of mouth.\nHe said in 2019 that he \"hates\" advertising, and the automaker only began ramping up its ad spending in 2023 after shareholders asked about it.\nTesla's ad-lite approach may have worked when the company was the only EV game in town — but now that competition is on the rise and with damage to Tesla's brand mounting, Valdez Streaty said the automaker could benefit from a marketing blitz.\nShe said, \"There's more competition, and how do you kind of elevate your brand or your models when there's so much out there?\"\nTesla has benefited from endorsements from Musk's ally, President Donald Trump. Last month, Trump marveled at a fleet of Tesla vehicles at a press event on the White House lawn. Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick even told people to buy the dip as the company's stock fell.\nThese were in response to protests, vandalism, and attacks against the company over Musk's involvement with the administration and his other political interventions. Analysts have cited politics as part of the reason for the company's stock decline.\nSales, too, will likely be affected if the anti-Tesla movement continues, Tucker said.\n\"Not a lot of people are going to cross a picket line to buy a car,\" he added.\nTesla\nElon Musk\nanalysis\nRead next",
        "Elon Musk's focus on DOGE has hurt Tesla's sales.\nBut how much has his DOGE bender affected the Cybertruck?\nQ1 estimates from Cox Automotive provide some clues.\nWe know that Elon Musk's DOGE bender has seriously hurt sales of Tesla cars. But what about the Cybertruck specifically?\nTesla doesn't break out quarterly delivery numbers for this divisive vehicle. But once a quarter, Cox Automotive estimates electric vehicle sales and includes a number for Cybertrucks.\nThis is one of the only sources where you can see how the Cybertruck performed in any period. The angular, futuristic beast is either loved or despised. As Musk has waded deeper into DOGE, this vehicle has become even more polarizing, if that was possible. (I've even stopped mentioning that I once had a reservation to buy a Cybertruck. Please don't tell anyone.)\nAbout a month ago, I was walking with a friend through my hometown and there was a Cybertruck parked near the sidewalk. It had a deep burgundy wrap and I remarked on that. My buddy started swearing and shouting about Elon and how despicable the vehicle was. I'd never seen him so angry (except when the Eagles lose).\nWith reactions like this, I've been wondering if anyone at all would buy a Cybertruck this year. And yet, I see them around Silicon Valley relatively often still. So, how did it do in Q1?\nCox estimates that Tesla sold 6,406 Cybertrucks in the first three months of 2025.\nThat compares to 12,991 units in the fourth quarter of 2024 before Elon went full DOGE. (This decline happened even as Tesla cut prices.)\nA year ago, in the first quarter of 2024, Tesla delivered 2,803 Cybertrucks, according to Cox.\nThe Cybertruck had been outselling some other EV truck models. But this time, in Q1, Ford sold more F-150 Lightning trucks, according to Cox estimates.\nAt one point, in the third quarter of 2024, the Cybertruck was the third-most-popular EV in the US, outselling every other non-Tesla electric vehicle, according to Cox.\nQ3 seems such a long time ago now.",

        "MADISON, Wis. – County judge Susan Crawford has won election to the Wisconsin Supreme Court, according to a race call by the Associated Press.\nCrawford defeated Brad Schimel, who received financial support from Elon Musk and an endorsement from President Donald Trump. Her victory means that the nonpartisan court's 4-3 liberal majority will remain in place.\nThe race was projected to be the most expensive state supreme court election ever by The Brennan Center for Justice, a think tank and democracy advocacy group. Spending by the candidates and their supporters reportedly topped $100 million.\nThe money fueled a bruising election cycle. That's in part because of the national stakes in the race, which was seen as a measure of voter sentiment and an early indication of how one swing state would respond to the involvement of Trump-aligned figures.\nShortly after 9:30 p.m. local time Crawford addressed cheering supporters and said Schimel had called her to concede the race. She referenced the money Musk had given in support of her opponent.\n\"As a little girl growing up in Chippewa Falls, I never could have imagined that I'd be taking on the richest man in the world for justice in Wisconsin — and we won,\" Crawford said, vowing to be a \"fair, impartial and common sense justice.\"\nSchimel told his supporters he had conceded. When some in the crowd yelled, \"No,\" or said the Democrats had cheated, he answered, \"No, no, no, no. You gotta accept the results.\" He played bass in his classic rock band before and after his concession.\nAs of 11:15 p.m. local time, 94 percent of the votes had been counted and Crawford was ahead 54.4% to Schimel's 45.6%. Turnout was high for a judicial election.\nAndy Manis/AP\nAbortion, unions and maybe redistricting could be decided by the court\nAmong the issues before the court is abortion -- and whether a pre-Civil War ban supersedes state law currently allowing abortion in Wisconsin up to about 20 weeks of pregnancy. Another case covers a landmark 2011 law that banned most Wisconsin public employees from collective bargaining.\nMusk injected himself into the race saying the court could end up redrawing voting districts in a way that might cost Republicans their majority in the U.S. House of Representatives. He and groups aligned with him gave some $20 million to support Schimel, a conservative. He also offered $100 to people who signed a petition against \"activist judges.\" At a rally on Sunday, he gave out $1 million each to two attendees.\nMusk's company, Tesla, has sued the state of Wisconsin for the right to sell cars directly to consumers. Current state law says most cars must be sold through dealerships.\nCrawford has worked on reproductive rights and voting rights as a private attorney\nBorn and raised in northwestern Wisconsin, Crawford shaped her early career alongside former Wisconsin Democratic Gov. Jim Doyle, first as his assistant attorney general, and later as his general counsel. She later worked as a private attorney on cases representing Planned Parenthood, unions, and challenging Wisconsin's voter ID law. She was elected as a circuit court judge in Dane County, home to the capital city of Madison, in 2018.\nSchimel, a Waukesha County judge, is a former Republican state attorney general who has backed the voter ID law and said the old abortion law was valid, but the issue should be subject to the \"will of the people.\"\nCrawford and her backers sought to paint Schimel as an extension of the Trump White House and herself as the more measured jurist with a stronger record on women's issues.\nCrawford was supported by the Wisconsin Democratic Party, which contributed at least $10 million to her race. National megadonors like Illinois Gov. JB Pritzker, George Soros and the Schusterman family also contributed to the party.\nShe was also endorsed by former President Barack Obama, several labor unions, Planned Parenthood, and EMILYs List, a Washington, D.C.-based group that supports abortion rights candidates.\nSchimel received huge sums from conservative backers including owners of the UIine packaging company, Richard and Elizabeth Uihlein, and their Fair Courts America PAC. Schimel also received at least $9 million from the Wisconsin GOP.\nNeither Schimel nor Crawford would commit to recusing from hearing cases involving the state parties or other prominent donors. Both sought to portray the other as uniquely beholden to their donors, even as state law offers judges wide latitude when it comes to deciding how and when to recuse.\nCrawford is to be sworn in on Aug. 1, to serve a term of ten years.\nAnya van Wagtendonk is the state capitol reporter for Wisconsin Public Radio.

        "Annual revenue, profit, stock prices and sold EVs show how close the competition is between Tesla and its Chinese rival, BDY.",
        "When Tesla launched the Cybertruck in 2023, it was the product of four years of hype. The boxy electric pickup was the company's first new model since 2020. Kim Kardashian, Pharrell Williams, and Justin Bieber were spotted riding around in it. With a million people on the truck's reservation list and a $120,000 price tag, it quickly became a status symbol.\nLess than two years later, the waitlist has disappeared. Trucks are piling up in sales lots. Fewer than 50,000 vehicles have been delivered. Some owners have become political targets thanks to CEO Elon Musk's association with President Donald Trump.\nEnter a quiet rebrand.\nOver the past few months, Tesla has moved to position the Cybertruck as a working man's vehicle — less DeLorean, more Ford F-150. The company updated its website, ditching an other-worldly aesthetic for images that feature the truck hauling equipment and an Airstream trailer. And sales workers at the company told Business Insider it's become increasingly difficult to move the truck off sales lots. The vehicle, they said, needs to appeal to the traditional truck buyer.\n\"Pitching it to truck people is more about the functionality,\" said one salesperson who works in the South. \"They want to know how much it can tow, how much can fit in the truck bed.\"\nAs the company prepares to deliver first quarter earnings, it faces sluggish delivery numbers, a brand crisis, and a stock price down over 43% year to date — and is looking for a boost.\n\"They initially pushed too hard into the out-of-this-world aesthetic,\" Ivan Drury, the director of insight for the automotive research firm Edmunds, told Business Insider. \"That only appeals to the outskirts of the market. Now they need to take a more traditional route.\"\nTaking on the traditional truck market\nAs recently as April 9, Tesla's website included renderings of the truck in a Mars-like atmosphere and ad copy that touted it was \"built for any planet\" with a \"cabin as quiet as outer space.\" (The brand famously shies away from traditional advertising and relies on Musk, the website, its reputation, and its X presence to sell vehicles.)\nEarly on, Ford CEO Jim Farley dismissed the Cybertruck as only for \"Silicon Valley people\" and \"like a cool high-end product parked in front of a hotel.\"\nRelated stories\nBusiness Insider tells the innovative stories you want to know\nBusiness Insider tells the innovative stories you want to know\n\"I don't make trucks like that,\" Farley said shortly before the Cybertruck's release. \"I make trucks for real people who do real work, and that's a different kind of truck.\"\nIn mid-April, Tesla redesigned its product page for the first time since the truck's release. Gone are the futuristic aesthetics and allusions to Mars; now the vehicle is fit for a construction worker or a family outing.\nIt's strikingly similar to advertisements for the 2024 model of Ford's F-150, the best-selling pickup in the US for the past 40 years.\nThe lead image for both truck's webpages featured Airstream trailers, and both included images of truck beds filled with wire.\nTesla and Ford did not respond to a request for comment.\nThe cheaper, scaled-down version of the Tesla truck, which launched in April, is also similar in price, range, and towing capacity to Ford's electric F-150.\nTwo Tesla sales workers told Business Insider that they've seen a push to market the vehicle more toward the typical truck buyer since late last year. The sales worker who works in a Southern state said the truck's flashy exterior has made it difficult to find people willing to buy it.\n\"Most of the test drivers aren't real truck buyers,\" they said. \"It's more of a novelty thing.\"\nDespite the truck's \"bulletproof\" exterior, Tesla struggled to market it as worksite-friendly and durable early on. Within weeks of its release, owners and critics took to social media to post Cybertruck fails, including footage of the truck getting stuck in snow or struggling to drive up a dirt hill. The phenomenon even spawned a popular Reddit channel with more than 300,000 members called \"Cyberstuck.\" The pickup has also had eight recalls since its release.\nEven though a typical truck owner may not work on a farm or a construction site, there's value in selling that image. Drury sees the new marketing materials as a step in the right direction.\n\"They need to advertise durability. It needs to be used and abused, and all of the capabilities that make it a work truck need to be on full display,\" Drury said. \"People might not use it for those capabilities, but it's about selling an image or lifestyle.\"\nMusk's pivot\nTesla's Cybertruck revamp has coincided with Musk's rightward political shift.\nTraditionally, Teslas have appealed to left-leaning buyers; many of the company's sales centers are located in blue states and urban areas, and Democrats have been more likely to purchase an EV.\nBut as Musk has become increasingly tied to President Donald Trump and DOGE, some of those people have started to turn on Tesla, staging protests outside sales centers. Other people have vandalized Cybertrucks and targeted their owners.\nTesla's sales numbers have followed suit, particularly for the Cybertruck. The company sold 6,406 Cybertrucks during the first three months of 2025, about half the number it sold the previous quarter, according to an estimate from Cox Automotive.\nAlong with pitches from Trump and Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick, the \"working man\" marketing may well appeal to a different kind of customer. (Tapping into a broader cultural push toward traditional masculinity, which Musk has championed, also doesn't hurt.)\nAt least one analyst sees a potential red-state boon. \"Tesla could actually net meaningful sales gains over time\" in red counties, Itay Michaeli, a TD Cowen analyst, wrote in March.\nPolitics aside, the Auto Trader editor Brian Moody told Business Insider that he thinks the Cybertruck marketing strategy has been a smart move for the brand and represents a natural progression.\n\"Right out of the gate, they were appealing to the Tesla fans, but most of those people have probably already bought the car, and now they have to appeal to the regular people,\" Moody said. \"Now they need to focus on the practicality.\"\nDo you work for Tesla or have a tip?

In the follow-up call, Tesla CFO Vaibhav Taneja said that vandalism and anti-Tesla hostility \"had an impact in certain markets.\" Musk also announced during the call that he plans to take a significant step back from his role with DOGE starting next month.\nThe apparent impact of the protests seems to have spurred more interest in organizing efforts.\nTesla Takedown told Business Insider that its post-earnings email announcement had an open rate of over 53%, an increase from the roughly 30% average open rate it had in its four previous emails. The organization also said that more than 30 new protests were added to its Action Network page within about 24 hours of the earnings release. During the same period, it said its follower count on Bluesky rose by 10% to 15%, compared to its typical weekly growth on social media of less than 5%.\nThe group, which has organized hundreds of protests in the past few months against Elon Musk's DOGE efforts, also said in a press release that \"the movement to hold Musk accountable for attacks\" on public services will move beyond Tesla.\n\"Tesla Takedown has already started laying the groundwork to expand Tesla Takedown efforts to target other Musk businesses including SpaceX, Starlink, X and xAI,\" the organization said in the statement.\nOther similar protest movements against Musk show little sign of slowing down.

        "Donald Trump's tariff onslaught appears to have finally driven a wedge between him and Elon Musk.\nThe world's richest person has been one of Trump's biggest cheerleaders — but when it comes to the tariffs that have shaken global markets, Musk has made it clear he's not a fan.\nThe Tesla CEO spent the weekend subtly dissing the president's \"reciprocal\" tariffs and warring with Peter Navarro, Trump's top trade advisor.\nMusk told a meeting of Italian politicians on Saturday he hoped for a \"zero-tariff system\" between Europe and the US, and traded barbs with Navarro.\nThe Washington Post reported that Musk made a personal appeal to Trump over the weekend to reverse his sweeping tariff plan, without success. Musk did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\nOn Monday, as global markets fell for a third straight day after the Trump administration doubled down on reciprocal tariffs, Musk posted a video of legendary economist Milton Friedman extolling the virtues of free trade.\nMusk has been a longtime opponent of tariffs, even when they benefit his businesses.\nLast year, the billionaire spoke out against President Joe Biden's 100% tariff on Chinese EV makers, which locked Tesla rival BYD out of the US.\n\"Tesla competes quite well in the market in China with no tariffs and no deferential support. In general, I'm in favor of no tariffs,\" Musk said at the time.\nTesla's tariff headache\nThe tariffs Trump has unveiled since returning to office pose far more of a threat to Tesla.\nAlthough the EV maker is better positioned than its rivals to cope with the 25% tax on imported vehicles that came into effect last week, the tariff will still raise the costs of the parts Tesla imports into the US.\nAbout 25% of the components for the Model Y are manufactured outside the US, according to regulatory documents, and Musk has warned that the tariff impact on the company will be \"significant.\"\nThe round of \"reciprocal\" tariffs announced last week has less of a direct impact on Tesla — but the resulting market chaos has added fuel to the fire of Tesla's alarming stock decline.\nThe automaker's share price has fallen more than 11% over the past five days amid a broader market slide, and is now down 38% this year. That decline help push Musk's net worth below $300 billion for the first time since November on Monday.\nMusk also has more reason than most to be worried about the consequences of the brewing trade war.\nLike other US companies, Tesla relies on the global supply chain — but the company is especially dependent on China, Tesla's second-biggest market and the site of a gigafactory.\nChina risk\nThat makes Tesla a ripe target if the Chinese government chooses to retaliate against US firms.\nChina and the US traded further tariff threats on Monday, and the country's commerce ministry vowed China would \"fight to the end\" in a statement on Tuesday.\nAnalysts have warned the escalating trade war with China could also drive Chinese consumers to shun Tesla in favor of local brands, in a patriotic trend similar to the \"buy Canadian\" movement.\n\"The backlash from Trump tariff policies in China and Musk's association will be hard to understate and this will further drive Chinese consumers to buy domestic such as BYD, Nio, Xpeng, and others,\" Wedbush analyst and Tesla bull Dan Ives wrote in a Sunday note.\nBYD pulls ahead of Tesla\nQuarterly electric vehicle sales\nQ12024Q2Q3Q4Q12025 300K350K400K450K500K550K600K\nBYD\nTesla\nSource: Company filings\nAndy Kiersz/BI\nRising brand toxicity in China would worsen Tesla's already precarious position in the country.

        "Tesla fans are still waiting for the $200,000 Roadster, which Elon Musk unveiled in 2017.\nTwo ex-Tesla employees have cofounded their own EV startup, Longbow, and aim to deliver their Roadster before Tesla.\nThey told BI how Longbow's 'lightness' approach gives an edge in building a new electric sports car.\nTesla fans are still waiting for a new Roadster — and now two ex-Tesla employees are launching an EV startup that could steal Elon Musk's thunder.\nMusk promised the updated Tesla Roadster would be \"the fastest production car ever made, period\" when he unveiled it in 2017, but eight years later, the $200,000 rocket-boosted EV is nowhere to be seen, leaving some reservations holders with a serious case of buyers regret.\nDaniel Davey and fellow Tesla veteran Mark Tapscott are looking to fill that void.\nThe two electric car enthusiasts founded British EV startup Longbow in 2023 along with Jenny Keisu, the former CEO of electric boat maker X Shore, and are now looking to disrupt their former employer with a range of lightweight electric sports cars.\nLongbow's first vehicle will be the Speedster, a limited-production £84,995 ($112,000) open-top sports car that the company describes as a \"statement of intent,\" with deliveries beginning next year.\nThat will be followed by the Roadster, a £64,995 ($85,500) production vehicle that serves as a nod to Elon Musk's infamously delayed supercar.\n\"The Tesla Roadster was announced in 2017. On the day, people were paying deposits by credit card there and then for $250,000. It was called the Tesla Roadster 2020,\" said Davey.\n\"We will deliver a Roadster before Tesla delivers a Roadster. And ours will be lighter and cooler,\" he added.\nFrom selling Tesla's EVs to building their own\nDavey and Tapscott joined Tesla in the early 2010s and helped launch the Roadster and the Model S, the brand's first two vehicles, in Europe — a process that was far from smooth.\n\"I was employee 650, spent some time in California, then came Europe with the Roadster back when there was no charging infrastructure, no one knew who Tesla or Elon was, and all of it was uphill,\" said Davey.\nTapscott says he joined Tesla after being wowed by the original Roadster. After contacting Musk and former Apple exec George Blankenship, he was tasked with selling the first two Model S vehicles in the UK.\n\"I was driving up and down the country, showing those cars to everybody, charging at whatever pub or hotel you could stop off at,\" said Tapscott, who worked for Tesla for seven years.\n\"The first ever test drive with the Model S in the UK, the guy turned up in his Ferrari, crashed the car, and pretty much wrote it off,\" he added.\nThe two Tesla veterans went on to work with a whos-who of EV companies, including Lucid, Hyundai, and Chinese automakers like BYD.\nDavey, who returned to Tesla in 2018 to launch the Model 3 in Europe (\"Elon was sleeping on the sofa, no one else at the company had any sleep,\" was how he described that period), told BI that harnessing their wealth of experience would be key to avoiding the fate of other failed EV startups.\n\"We have done this multiple times, and all our peers who could do this are moving their way up to Vice President/Senior VP level and working in VCs because they're not crazy enough to apply that knowledge at the beginning again,\" he said.\nLongbow's 'speed of lightness'\nAfter a boom in the early 2020s, the past few years have seen numerous once-promising EV startups collapse as electric vehicle sales growth has slowed and funding has dried up.\nMeanwhile, legacy automakers have also sought to launch increasingly affordable, mass-market electric offerings as they look to boost adoption and sales.\nThat makes it an unusual time to launch a mid-range electric sportscar — but Longbow's cofounders believe the lack of competition gives the startup an opening.\n\"It's a scandal that no one else is focusing on this segment,\" said Davey.\n\"We're passionate about the products in the segment, but from a logical perspective, it is the best place to be building cars. You have the best margins, and there is no competition,\" he added.\nTapscott said that Longbow's approach to building its cars was centered on the concept of \"speed of lightness.\"\nRather than choosing to build the majority of components in-house — a process that has seen other startups like Tesla and Rivian face an EV \"valley of death\" as production has scaled up before profits — Longbow plans to buy most of its components off the shelf from outside suppliers.\nDavey and Tapscott argue that will allow the startup to be more flexible, improve margins, and take advantage of an EV supply chain that is far more developed than when Tesla began building the first Roadster.\n\"We don't have to build a billion-dollar factory just to get a single motor,\" said Tapscott.\nAlthough Longbow is making an effort to prioritize local suppliers in the UK, some of its supply chain will likely include Chinese EV tech.\nHaving worked with Chinese EV companies in the past, Tapscott and Davey described the technology coming out of the world's most competitive auto market as \"breathtaking.\"\n\"A lot of components come from China, where it's appropriate, especially [battery] cells, right? We will leverage that,\" said Davey.\n\"But we really want to lean into and support the local supply chain,\" he said, adding that Longbow expects to finalize its supply chain nine months before deliveries begin in late 2026.\nDavey and Tapscott declined to say how many reservations Longbow has received so far but described the response to the Speedster and the Roadster as highly encouraging.\n\"Tesla builds 2 million cars a year … but at some point, the disruptors become the disrupted,\" said Davey.\nTesla\nStartup\nRead next",
        "The Cybertruck is coming to Saudi Arabia as Tesla battles to revive Elon Musk's \"apocalypse-proof\" truck around.\nTesla announced this month it would start selling the Cybertruck in Saudi Arabia, as well as the UAE and Qatar, marking the first time the divisive electric pickup has been sold outside North America. Deliveries will begin in \"late 2025,\" per Tesla's website.\nThe arrival of the Cybertruck in Saudi Arabia — where EV chargers are scarce and the market for electric cars is tiny — comes amid underwhelming sales of the stainless steel-clad vehicle.\nTesla sold just 6,406 Cybertrucks in the first three months of 2025, according to data from Cox Automotive. Employees previously told Business Insider that some production targets for the truck at the Austin gigafactory had been dropped.\nThe automaker has delivered fewer than 50,000 of the trucks as of March 20, according to a recall notice.\nThat's a long way from the lofty targets set out by Musk before the Cybertruck launched in 2023.\nThe world's richest person said Tesla planned to produce 200,000 Cybertrucks a year, and there were some 1.5 million reservations for the trapezoid truck before its release, according to one online tally reported by Electrek.\n\"There's really no way to describe its sales record today as anything other than a severe disappointment,\" Glenn Mercer, the president of automotive consultancy GM Automotive, told BI.\nLaunching an all-electric truck in the oil-producing region is a novel approach to turning around the Cybertruck's lackluster sales. It might be one of the few options open to Tesla.\nWhat if I told you I'm coming to the Middle East this year pic.twitter.com/ckDbNGvFTg\n— Cybertruck (@cybertruck) April 10, 2025\nMercer said that the Cybertruck's unique design and sheer size meant it faced major barriers to entry in Europe and China, Tesla's biggest markets outside North America.\nRelated stories\nBusiness Insider tells the innovative stories you want to know\nBusiness Insider tells the innovative stories you want to know\nIn the European Union, where Tesla sold more than 300,000 cars last year, narrow roads and strict regulations mean the Cybertruck can only be driven with major modifications. One of the first trucks to appear in the UK was seized by police earlier this year as it was not road-legal.\nDespite shipping some Cybertrucks to China last year for display purposes, Tesla also faces headwinds in selling the electric pickup in its second-largest — and most competitive — market.\nMusk said on X last year that making a Cybertruck road-legal in China would be \"very difficult.\" Pickup trucks in China have a history of strict regulation, although some of those rules have been loosened in recent years.\nBoth China and Europe have tiny pickup markets compared with the US, so it's not clear whether the investment required to change the Cybertruck's design and build a network of repair shops to service the truck's unique features would be economic.\nMercer said Tesla would likely try to reposition the Cybertruck as a boutique luxury vehicle for small international markets such as Saudi Arabia and the UAE as it expands outside North America.\n\"Given the high cost of adjusting the vehicle to each local market, I would imagine they would try to sell a very expensive, high-priced version of it as a niche or premium vehicle to make it worthwhile going after a dozen small overseas markets,\" he said.\nAs a result, taking the Cybertruck global is unlikely to do much to turn around Tesla's sales slump — or halt the \"brand crisis tornado\" that has turned some of the trucks into a target.",
        "A 19-year-old has been charged with firebombing Cybertrucks at a Tesla dealership.\nThere has been a spate of attacks on Tesla to protest CEO Elon Musk's role in the government.\nThe Justice Department has warned it would pursue severe penalties for attacks on Tesla properties.\nThe Justice Department charged a 19-year-old with \"firebombing\" Cybertrucks in Kansas.\nThe government charged Owen McIntire, 19, with one count of unlawful possession of an unregistered destructive device and one count of malicious damage by fire, the Justice Department said.\nMcIntire made his first court appearance on Friday, but it was unclear if he had yet secured an attorney.\nProtesters angry with Tesla CEO Elon Musk's work with the White House DOGE Office to reduce government spending and cut staff have attacked several Tesla facilities across the United States in recent weeks. Musk has said DOGE seeks to cut at least $1 trillion from the federal budget. Its efforts are now the subject of several lawsuits.\nData from Cox Automotive shows that used Tesla listings reached a record high in March. The company's stock price has also plummeted. And coordinated protests targeting Tesla took place across the country late last month.\nTwo weeks before those protests, on March 17, the Justice Department said officers of the Kansas City Police Department in Missouri saw smoke coming from a Cybertruck parked at a Tesla dealership. The officers saw an unbroken Molotov cocktail near the smoking truck. The officer recovered the Molotov cocktail, but the fire still spread to a second Cybertruck.\nAttorney General Pamela Bondi previously said the Justice Department would seek 20 years in prison for another man accused of attacking a Tesla dealership in Colorado.\nBondi said that the Kansas City incident should serve as another reminder that \"anyone who still wants to firebomb a Tesla property: you will not evade us.\"\n\"You will be arrested. You will be prosecuted. You will spend decades behind bars. It is not worth it,\" Bondi said. One of the charges McIntire faces carries a maximum penalty of 20 years.\nFBI Director Kash Patel said in the Justice Department press release that this is the second arrest of a suspect targeting Tesla this week, which is \"more proof that the FBI will not stand for these destructive acts.\"\n\"These actions are dangerous, they are illegal, and we are going to arrest those responsible,\" Patel said.\nThe Justice Department says the two damaged Cybertrucks had a combined sale price of $212,970. The fire also damaged two charging stations, which were valued at $550 each.",
        "Tesla said on Tuesday that it plans to launch a \"pilot\" robotaxi service in Austin in June.\nThat does not mean we'll see the two-door Cybercabs on the roads this summer.\nHere's what Tesla revealed during its first-quarter earnings call.\nTesla provided more details about its planned June robotaxi launch in Austin during Tuesday's Q1 earnings call.\nA robotaxi service from Tesla comes years after several missed deadlines and an increasingly competitive — but smaller — field.\nGeneral Motors's Cruise bowed out of the race earlier this year, but Alphabet's Waymo has continuously ramped up its service and is now providing 200,000 rides a week in limited parts of the San Francisco Bay Area, Phoenix, Atlanta, and Austin, according to the company.\nThere's also Amazon's Zoox, which makes its own purpose-built robotaxi, and other software-focused companies that hope to provide autonomous driving features to original equipment manufacturer vehicles.\nBut Elon Musk swears by the company's approach to autonomy.\nDuring the earnings call, he described Tesla's self-driving capabilities as a \"generalized solution using artificial intelligence.\"\nThe CEO has touted this approach before, which refers to Tesla's reliance on cameras — as opposed to a pricey hardware stack made up of sensors and cameras — and an AI that will use the visual input to drive the vehicle. This could allow for Tesla to scale autonomy quicker and at lower costs since, in theory, any Tesla model could be deployed as a robotaxi.\n\"I predict there will be millions of Teslas operating autonomously — fully autonomously — in the second half of next year,\" Musk said during the call.\nHere's what we now know about Tesla's robotaxi service — and some lingering questions:\nWhat will Tesla's planned robotaxi rollout look like in June?\nTesla was careful to call the robotaxi service we'll see in June a \"pilot\" rollout, which hints at the limited scale of the initial launch.\nRelated stories\nBusiness Insider tells the innovative stories you want to know\nBusiness Insider tells the innovative stories you want to know\nMusk said during the call that \"day one\" of the robotaxi service will start out with \"maybe 10 or 20 vehicles.\" From there, Tesla will \"scale it up rapidly,\" he said.\n\"Once we make it work in a few cities, we can basically make it work in all cities in that legal jurisdiction,\" he said.\nWhich Tesla cars will be used for the robotaxi launch?\nThe first set of Tesla robotaxis is expected to be Model Ys through a software update, according to Musk.\n\"With the software update, it will become autonomous,\" Musk said. \"To be clear, the Model Ys that we're talking about being autonomous in Austin in June are the Model Ys we make currently. There's no change to it.\"\nIt's unclear if the first batch of robotaxis will be managed directly by Tesla or if it will consist of privately owned Teslas through which owners will opt in to the service.\nThe CEO also clarified that the Cybercab is a separate product. In October 2024, Tesla unveiled a purpose-built, two-door robotaxi with no steering wheel.\n\"We've got a product called the Cybercab,\" he said during the Tuesday earnings call. \"And then if any Tesla — which could be a (model) S, 3, X, or Y that is autonomous — is a robotic taxi or robotaxi. It's very confusing.\"\nSo, when will we get the Cybercab?\nVolume production of Cybercab is still on schedule for 2026, Lars Moravy, Tesla's vice president of vehicle engineering, said during the call.\nMoravy said that the company is currently at the \"B-sample validation\" of the vehicle, which means Tesla is building the prototype of the car but using material that will be close to the final product.\n\"Big builds\" or the next stage of vehicle-building before volume production is coming at the end of the second quarter, Moravy said.\nTesla anticipates that it will be able to pump out Cybercabs quickly at scale by using what the company calls its \"unboxed\" method of manufacturing.\nTraditional car manufacturers build cars on an assembly line. Tesla is betting on a new method where different parts of the car are simultaneously assembled and then later combined.\n\"We're still on schedule for production next year,\" Moravy said.\nHow can we order a Tesla robotaxi in June?\nTesla didn't address how people in Austin will be able to order a robotaxi at launch during the earnings call.\nThe company has previously teased its ride-hailing mobile app last year, in which a user can \"summon\" a car and adjust the climate settings before it arrives.\nWhen will Tesla robotaxis be available outside Austin?\nMusk didn't provide an exact timeline for Tesla's expansion plans. But the CEO gave some pretty ambitious numbers.\nOn top of predicting \"millions\" of robotaxis on the road by the second half of next year, Musk said he predicts Tesla will take \"90-something percent\" of the rideshare market.\nMusk is so bullish on these numbers because, in theory, any Tesla on the road should be able to function as a robotaxi through a software update.\nThis is different from a company like Waymo, which not only relies on sensors and cameras for its autonomous vehicle but also needs to map out a city before its robotaxis can be deployed to the public.\nA Waymo spokesperson did not respond to a request for comment.\nRead next",
        "Business Insider visited the construction site where Tesla's restaurant concept is taking shape.\nThe retro futuristic diner with EV chargers appears to be near completion.\nTwo looming movie screens can be seen towering in the sky from a few blocks away.\nAmid Elon Musk's recent blitzkrieg of government spending cuts, the billionaire Tesla founder has simultaneously been making quiet, breakneck progress on an entirely different business venture — the long-awaited Tesla Diner & Drive-In.\nThe Los Angeles-based project dates back to 2018, when Musk first mused online about an old-school 24-hour restaurant spot that would serve diner food and provide entertainment options for Tesla drivers needing to charge their electric vehicles.\nSeven years later, Musk's vision of a dual dining-charging spot has come to fruition. Looming tall over a busy Hollywood block, the site boasts two towering 45-foot LED movie screens and dozens of V4 Supercharger stalls, as well as a saucer-shaped, open-air rooftop sitting under Los Angeles' reliable sunshine.\nAs a former Business Insider reporter and West Hollywood resident, I spent one Friday morning earlier this month investigating the surprisingly quiet construction site ahead of the diner's still-unknown opening.\nHere's what I saw.\nThe site takes up an entire street corner on a busy section of Santa Monica Boulevard.\nThe Tesla Diner & Drive-In sits on the north side of LA's famous Santa Monica Boulevard, which runs from the Sunset Junction all the way to the Pacific Ocean. The plot extends backward onto N Orange Drive.\nThe site is near two of the busiest intersections in Hollywood, and only a few blocks from the 101 Freeway, where hundreds of thousands of drivers enter and exit traffic each day. The prime locale and easy freeway access plays in the diner's favor.\nBefore being transformed into Musk's retro-futuristic restaurant, the land was home to a Shakey's Pizza.\nIn August 2023, the Los Angeles County Department of Building and Safety approved plans for the Tesla diner. Construction had moved quickly in the year-and-a-half since. It appears to be nearly done.\nTesla and the engineering and architecture firm working on the project, Stantec, didn't respond to BI's requests for information about the completion or opening date of the restaurant.\nI was surprised by how quiet the construction site seemed for a Friday morning.\nI spent about twenty minutes perusing the diner's street corner, peering through the chain-link fence surrounding the entire enclosure. The graffiti-covered fence was covered by a tattered cloth, seemingly meant to keep looky-loos like me from snooping.\nBroken pieces of the cloth cover, however, allowed me a peek behind the curtain, where I observed four construction workers milling about. Two men stood chatting with one another on-site for the entirety of my twenty-minute visit, while two others worked independently on various projects around the building.\nI saw one private security guard standing outside the site.\nThe security guard, who was wearing an \"Allied Universal Security\" jacket, was standing on N Orange Drive, presumably watching over the site's side entrance.\nRelated stories\nBusiness Insider tells the innovative stories you want to know\nBusiness Insider tells the innovative stories you want to know\nThe nice young man told me he had \"no idea\" when the diner was supposed to open. Worth a shot!\nThe unmissable focal points of the site are its two towering video screens.\nIn an X post last month, Tesla investor Sawyer Merritt described the giant structures as 45-foot LED movie screens. Musk responded to the post, \"It will be cool.\"\nI didn't bring my tape measure to confirm their measurements, but I can confirm they are looming in every sense of the word.\nA 2022 building permit for the diner said the screens would show half-hour-long films — just enough time for a Tesla driver to charge up, The New York Times reported earlier this year.\nMore recently, Musk has said the screens will show old movie clips, contributing to the site's retro ambiance.\nIn 2023, he posted on X that the vibe of the space will be \"Grease meets Jetsons with Supercharging.\"\nThe two screens sit on diagonal ends of the half-acre complex, both wrapped in a metallic exterior.\nI could see the back of one of the screens from a few blocks away.\nI walked a mile from West Hollywood for my pilgrimage to the Tesla Diner & Drive-In. As I was approaching the site from a few blocks west, I first spotted the back of one of the giant video screens.\nI didn't know what the large structure in the sky was on my initial approach, but I snapped this pic on my walk back, after having witnessed the giant screens up close.\nHere's a view of one of the screens straight on.\nThis particular screen sits to the side of the diner building. The other screen is located out of lens, back and to the right.\nThe building itself is a silver-toned, saucer-like structure with geometric flourishes.\nSome of the fancy charging stations were all ready to go.\nDuring my visit to the site, I saw dozens of shiny, white, Tesla-branded charging stations starting to be installed in the diner's paved parking lot.\nEventually, the site will be home to more than 75 V4 Supercharger stalls, Merritt said in his March update on X.\nEven as Tesla takes Musk-related hits in recent weeks, Los Angeles remains an EV-friendly locale.\nMusk's EV company has felt the burn of his foray into politics, with Tesla sales plunging 13% in the first three months of 2025 — the company's worst quarter since the first three months of 2022. Stock is down more than 36% in 2025.\nMeanwhile, Tesla vehicles, dealerships, and charging stations across the country have been the sites of vandalism and protests since Trump was inaugurated.\nWhen the diner does open, it'll be hard to miss — whether by drivers looking for a charge or protesters who have made Tesla locations ground zero for expressing their discontent at Elon Musk's growing political influence.\nTesla\nElon Musk\nRead next\nBusiness Insider tells the innovative stories you want to know\nBusiness Insider tells the innovative stories you want to know\nBusiness Insider tells the innovative stories you want to know",
        "You don't have to spy from space to know Elon Musk is growing his business empire in Texas, but it shows just how massive his impact is becoming.\nThis week, Musk announced he plans to step back from the DOGE office in May to focus more time on Tesla. Before Tuesday, Tesla stock was down 44% this year.\nMusk has said that he's led his companies \"with great difficulty\" during his time with DOGE. His stepping back might give him more time to refocus on his other core companies, too, all of which have a growing footprint in Texas.\nIn the late 2010s, Musk had grown increasingly discontent with California laws and regulations and decided that Texas offered a more business-friendly environment.\nSo, in 2020, Musk's tunneling firm, The Boring Company, moved its headquarters from California to Texas, followed by Tesla in 2021 and X and SpaceX in 2024. Musk's smaller companies, Neuralink and X.AI, also have ties to Texas.\nThe satellite images below show his business's exponential growth across the Lone Star state over the last few years, and what Musk has in store next. Musk did not respond to a request for comment from Business Insider.",
        "Actor Alex Winter — of \"Bill and Ted's Excellent Adventure\" fame — was scrolling through the social network Bluesky in early February when he realized the rage against Elon Musk had the makings of a movement.\nThe Los Angeles-based director and writer saw a post by Joan Donovan, a sociologist at Boston University, on February 8, urging followers to \"bang some pots and pans on the sidewalks\" in front of Tesla dealerships.\nDonovan linked to Tesla's online tool for looking up nearby stores and showrooms and included a lone hashtag at the top of the post: #TeslaTakeover.\nWinter, 59, told Business Insider that he messaged Donovan on Bluesky and asked her if creating a website to centralize the protest effort would be a good idea.\n\"Go for it,\" Winter recalled Donovan saying.\nCreating the website — TeslaTakedown.com, a spin on Donovan's hashtag — took a few weeks. The first protest in Los Angeles, on February 15, drew only about 80 people. But the effort to create a go-to hub online paid off, Winter said. Two weeks after the website launched on February 14, more than 1,000 people turned out for a Tesla protest in Los Angeles.\nWinter and Donovan weren't alone in kick-starting the grassroots movement. Organizers cropped up around the world, and by the end of March, protests in more than 250 US cities and in 13 countries — complete with counterprotests — had thrust the anger with Musk into the zeitgeist.\n\"I think it's significant that this started on BlueSky because there's a lot of people who left Twitter when Elon Musk bought it, including myself,\" said Winter.\nDiscontent with Musk bubbled up into a full-fledged movement when the auto executive got political himself, turning much of his attention from his businesses to cost-cutting in the Trump administration's DOGE office.\nTesla didn't respond to a request for comment from Business Insider.\nMusk has repeatedly said his work with the White House has been about making the government more efficient and eliminating waste and fraud. He has also said the backlash against Tesla has been tough but that \"we're doing the right thing here.\"\nOrganizers and protesters against Tesla have told BI that owning one of Musk's vehicles has become a politically polarizing symbol. The anti-Tesla movement has coincided with the company's spectacular downturn. Shares in the electric automaker are down more than 40% this year, and vehicle sales are also declining.\nIn April, the carmaker released a disappointing first-quarter delivery report, showing it sold just under 336,700 EVs in the first three months of the year — a 13% drop from a year ago and its lowest quarterly deliveries since 2022. The company attributed the decline to overhauling its production lines ahead of the launch of the refreshed Model Y, which it said \"led to the loss of several weeks of production\" in the first quarter.\nMeanwhile, many Tesla owners — including celebrities such as Sheryl Crow, Bette Midler, and Jason Bateman — have looked to offload their vehicles. Used Tesla listings are up more than 30% this year, according to Cox Automotive, whose director of industry insights said in an industry forecast that Musk's unpopularity had an \"undeniable\" impact on the brand's image and sales.\nTo understand how the Tesla Takedown protests have unfolded, threatening Tesla's position as the world's most valuable automaker, Business Insider spoke with more than 45 organizers, protesters, customers, and brand experts.\nBumper stickers and early signs of unrest\nTesla looked poised to be a big winner after Musk bet hundreds of millions on Trump's reelection campaign (and it could still prove to be).\nIn October, Musk joined then-candidate Donald Trump onstage at a rally in New York City, announcing that he intended to help the government cut $2 trillion in spending.\nIn the days following the election, Tesla shares surged amid a broad market rally. The stock hit an all-time high in December.\nBut Musk's actions started to alarm people on the political left, many of whom had bought into Tesla's climate-conscious sales pitch to electrify the world's automotive fleet.\nWhile speaking to the crowd at Trump's inauguration celebration in January, Musk made a gesture perceived by many as a Nazi salute. Musk, who had also thrown his support behind Germany's right-wing AfD party, has repeatedly denied that the gesture had anything to do with Nazism.\nAround that time, signs of anti-Musk sentiment became increasingly visible in daily life, spilling out from social media and onto America's roads.\nBumper stickers appealing to embarrassed Tesla owners sold out by the thousands on Amazon and Redbubble.\nMatthew Hiller, an aquarium worker who sells anti-Elon Musk stickers online as a side hustle, said business boomed after the Tesla CEO made the inflammatory gesture.\nTikTokers calling themselves the \"Cybertruck Hunters\" began to deliberately follow Cybertrucks, using a projector to beam lines like \"I wonder if everyone who's passing me thinks I'm a Nazi?\" onto the body of the stainless-steel vehicle. Influencers created songs mocking the polarizing design of Cybertrucks that garnered millions of views.\nThen the protests began.\nBy the end of February, the movement took shape\nThe protests that eventually became the Tesla Takedown movement grew on an almost parallel timeline in different locations.\nOn February 1, Kathy Sprague, who lives in the Bay Area, showed up at Tesla's Berkeley showroom alone, carrying a picket sign and wearing a bear costume. A month later, wearing the same bear costume, she was joined by roughly 300 protesters.\nIn Corte Madera, California, Lara Starr, a writer and publicist in her 50s who runs a small local chapter of the feminist organization Solidarity Sundays, pulled together around 50 friends and associates for a protest on Presidents Day.\nBy the next week, Starr had helped organize a February 23 protest at her local showroom. The local chapter of Indivisible, a progressive movement organization that launched in 2016 in response to Trump, found out about the effort and turned out around 200 demonstrators.\nRelated stories\nBusiness Insider tells the innovative stories you want to know\nBusiness Insider tells the innovative stories you want to know\nIn Manhattan, Alice Hu, the director of Planet Over Profit, a youth-led organization for climate justice, said that she organized her first protest toward the end of February, inspired by other organizations that had cropped up across the country. Hu said her organization was \"very concerned watching the unelected takeover of the federal government\" so it was important for its members to join the protests.\nMost of the protests were peaceful — but others vented their frustrations against Musk in a more destructive way.\nVandalism and arson attacks catch the eye of the White House\nAt times, Musk chose to downplay the demonstrations or challenge their authenticity, calling them \"fake rallies\" and the participants \"paid\" protesters.\nBut viral images of the charred remains of Tesla vehicles and graffitied Tesla dealerships became impossible to ignore as anger against Musk boiled over into vandalism and attacks on showrooms.\nThings were getting ugly, with police investigating multiple arson incidents.\nOne protester was arrested and charged with throwing \"firebomb\" at a Tesla dealership in Colorado, and authorities arrested a man in South Carolina who they said had set fire to Tesla charging stations.\nMusk weighed in online and in media appearances, denouncing the attacks and saying it was a \"shock\" to see \"this level of, really, hatred and violence from the left.\"\n\"I understand if you don't want to buy our product,\" Musk said during an all-hands meeting at Tesla on March 20, \"but you don't have to burn it down.\"\nThe attacks on Tesla dealerships caught the eye of the White House.\nOn March 11, Trump hosted an event on the south lawn of the White House in which he perused a line of Tesla cars before picking out one to buy for himself. He spoke glowingly of Musk and reiterated that the auto exec had his full support. When asked if the attacks should be considered \"domestic terrorism,\" Trump agreed.\nThere's no evidence that these individual acts are connected to Tesla Takedown organizers, and its organizers have said they don't endorse property damage.\n\"If you've bought a Cybertruck in the last six months, I might question your decency,\" Starr said. \"But I think a point should be made that this is not about harassing or wagging a finger at Tesla drivers, and we are also respectful of the folks who are working at Tesla.\"\nIn March, the movement reached a fever pitch\nThe Tesla Takedown movement flexed its organizing might in March.\nAs DOGE was in full swing in its efforts to cut jobs and end DEI initiatives that the White House described as \"radical and wasteful,\" organizers coordinated the biggest protest yet on March 29.\nSome leaders found themselves targeted over their efforts. After announcing plans for the day of demonstrations, Hu said she faced doxxing and threats.\nProtests around the US drew large crowds, with thousands showing up at some locations, organizers told BI.\nOn the West Coast, at least 2,000 protesters showed up at a showroom in Walnut Creek, California. One in Portland drew more than 1,000 people. More than 700 protesters flocked to a Boston showroom.\nBusiness Insider attended two Tesla Takedown protests in Michigan. On the rainy Saturday, a crowd of mostly older demonstrators carrying handmade signs assembled outside Tesla dealerships.\nMike Whitty, 83, said the turnout was impressive for such a rainy day.\n\"Just because he's a billionaire, that doesn't mean he can become the co-president, try to knock out our government,\" he told BI. \"Golly, they're going to wreck the Michigan auto industry with tariffs. They're going to hurt our economy in a worse way than many states that are not as focused on one big product.\"\n\"I'm concerned about how Elon Musk has taken over our government as a nonelected citizen,\" Patti Kubota, 23, said at a protest in Troy. \"I'm worried about fascism and the takeover of our safety and government.\"\n\"I have friends that own Teslas and they're mortified,\" said another Michigan protester who declined to share her name and age. \"One friend, a work colleague, said that they bought their Tesla before the election. They only have 18,000 miles on it. They wanted to sell it.

One website features a digital map with a Molotov cocktail cursor revealing information about former and current Tesla owners and DOGE employees.\n\"I think it's irresponsible and extra-judicial punishment for people that have nothing to do with what is going on in Washington,\" Victor Vescovo, one of the Tesla owners whose information was listed on the website, told BI, adding that he supports DOGE's mission.\nAnother, who said he was looking to sell his vehicle, said in a message that he supports \"whatever civil disobedience people take out on Tesla, the company, but it's upsetting to see people glorifying violence against owners.\"\nOne Tesla owner, Ben Baker, said someone keyed his Model Y and left a crude drawing on it soon after the election.\nBaker, who loves the Cybertruck and recently owned one, decided to return the vehicle because he was concerned his kids could be harassed.\nAnother Tesla owner, 46-year-old David Abrams, told BI he doesn't agree with Musk's actions, but selling his Tesla would be a \"major financial hit,\" given that he doesn't have a car payment and the company already has his money.\nHe also plans to keep \"Anti-Elon Tesla Club\" and \"I bought this before Elon went crazy\" Tesla stickers on his car.\n'All eyes are on upcoming Tesla earnings'\nProtesters say they plan to return to Tesla dealerships for demonstrations in the coming weeks, perhaps not with the same numbers as the March 29 Tesla Takedown and not all on the same day.\nThere are at least 80 planned protests in the US, according to the Tesla Takedown website.\nA Tesla Takedown spokesperson told BI in an email that \"all eyes are on upcoming Tesla earnings on 4/22,\" and they're hopeful that the stock price will continue to plummet, which would \"speed up the timeline for Elon Musk to be removed from the Trump Regime.\"\nIt's difficult to gauge the precise impact the protests have had on the company. Boycott movements historically don't move the needle much — and automotive industry experts have told BI they aren't sold on the idea that Tesla's declining sales are a direct result of boycotting efforts.\nBut the most recent quarter's delivery numbers were jarring even to those who are typically enthusiastic about Tesla. Ross Gerber, a longtime investor, and the Tesla bull Dan Ives attributed the disappointing data to brand damage.\nRyan Brinkman, a JPMorgan analyst and Tesla bear, said even he may have underestimated the impact of negative sentiment.\n\"Tesla's 1Q sales and production report causes us to think that — if anything — we may have underestimated the degree of consumer reaction,\" Brinkman wrote in a note on Friday.\nTesla has an uphill battle ahead, said David J. Reibstein, a professor of marketing at The Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania. Tesla must either focus on rebranding or face the challenge of targeting a completely different customer base, he said.\n\"We now have a brand highly associated with a single individual who has a strong association with a political brand, and that has carried over to the brand itself,\" he said.\nMusk, who navigated Tesla through challenges in the past, has told investors to \"hang on to your stock,\" pointing to Tesla's coming \"Cybercab\" robotaxi and Optimus robots as future growth opportunities for the company.\nStarr, the organizer, said many protest coordinators feel that Tesla locations have become a place for \"Americans who give a damn about our country\" to come together and voice their opinions.\n\"We can't all go to Washington or Mar-a-Lago, or another Trump property,\" she said, \"but we can turn out at hundreds of Tesla stores and charging stations in a very visible expression of our disgust.\"\nFor Winter, the protests' momentum signals that the tide is turning for how people view Musk.\n\"I've been concerned about Elon Musk back since he was at PayPal, and then with the purchase and dismantling of Twitter,\" he told BI. \"And now it has reared its head in a way that I think the rest of the world has woken up to.\"\nRelated stories\nBusiness Insider\nBusiness Insider tells the innovative stories you want to know\nBusiness Insider\nBusiness Insider tells the innovative stories you want to know\nBusiness Insider\nBusiness Insider tells the innovative stories you want to know\nMore from Tech\nMost popular",
        "Tesla's dominance in California's electric vehicle market is receding.\nIts slide in California continued into a sixth straight quarter, with registrations down 15.1% in early 2025 — even as overall new car registrations rose 8.3% year over year. The drop marks Tesla's steepest quarterly loss in more than a year and comes at a moment when the state's car market saw a boost ahead of anticipated tariffs, according to the California New Car Dealers Association.\nMeanwhile, Tesla's share of California's electric vehicle market dropped from 55.5% to 43.9% between the first quarters of 2024 and 2025, data from CNCDA showed.\nTesla's registrations declined even as the carmaker released in January a refreshed version of its top-selling Model Y. The company's aging lineup — anchored by models that haven't seen overhauls in years — has been increasingly outpaced by competitors.\nA spokesperson for Tesla did not respond to a request for comment.\nCalifornia has long been a key market for Tesla. It's the birthplace of Tesla and represents the largest EV market in the US. But its CEO's relationship with the state has soured in recent years.\nElon Musk relocated Tesla's headquarters to Texas in 2021 and has since ramped up his political visibility, aligning himself with conservative figures and policies. Those moves haven't gone unnoticed in California, where Democratic leaders have clashed with Musk publicly and voters lean blue. Musk's recent role with the White House DOGE office has sparked further backlash.\nTesla showrooms over the past few months have been inundated with demonstrators protesting Musk's involvement with President Donald Trump and DOGE.\nIn March, Tesla vehicles made up 1.4% of all trade-ins in California, up from just 0.4% a year earlier — a 250% increase, according to data from Edmunds, which looked at models from 2017 or later.\nTesla's California slump mirrors wider challenges for the automaker globally.\nOverall, Tesla reported its first-quarter delivery numbers were 13% lower than in the same period the previous year, marking its worst quarter since the beginning of 2022.\nTesla's stock is down 35% year to date.\nHave a tip?

        "Tesla owners have found themselves in the crosshairs of political protests across the world.\nElon Musk's involvement in the Trump administration has had a knock-on impact on his EV company.\nOne Tesla owner sold his Cybertruck, another told BI they sold company shares but kept the car.\nIn recent months, backlash against Elon Musk has spurred a Tesla boycott movement, pushing some owners and shareholders to ditch the brand — and, in some cases, leading to vandalism incidents.\nBusiness Insider spoke to four Tesla owners about their concerns on ownership amid a growing campaign against the EV giant.\nWhile one owner returned his Cybertruck as a precaution for his kids, the other three owners said they don't plan to get rid of their vehicles, despite the rise in anti-Tesla sentiment.\nThe following stories are based on transcribed conversations with Tesla owners. Business Insider has verified their identities and vehicle ownership. Their words have been edited for length and clarity.\nI'm a big Tesla fan, but returned my Cybertruck because my daughter was worried about getting bullied\nBen Baker is a Tesla owner living in Sacramento, California, who sold his Cybertruck.\nI'm a huge fan of technology. I already own a Tesla, which I absolutely love, and I really wanted a Cybertruck.\nI think Cybertrucks are freaking awesome. They're really fun to drive. They're roomy and spacious. I wasn't buying it for other people, I was buying the Cybertruck because I wanted to drive the future.\nNot too long ago, after the election, somebody keyed my Tesla Model Y, and I was like, \"OK, that's no big deal.\" I live in California, which is a Democratic state, and so I kind of figured that there would be some of that stuff. I didn't think it would be that big of a deal until I went and bought a Cybertruck.\nThe first week I drove the Cybertruck, I took my family to Starbucks in it. My family went in and I took some cool pictures. As I was doing that, three people walked behind me and started looking at me and laughing. Then one of them called me a Nazi.\nI go, \"What are you talking about? I'm just buying this awesome truck. I think it's awesome. I'm not a Nazi.\" They were like, \"Whatever, Nazi.\"\nI thought was weird.\nLater on, one of my daughters told me that if I kept the Cybertruck, she was going to get bullied. My son, who leans right, said I should be able to drive the car I want.\nI started thinking about if one of them is driving the Tesla Cybertruck and someone started vandalizing it. My daughter is young, she's had her license maybe a year. That's terrifying to me.\nI'm a father and I have to do the right thing by my kids. If I could afford to own a Cybertruck myself and then send them to school with another vehicle, then great, it would be on me if it got damaged. But I can't have that happen to them in that vehicle. And who knows how far these guys will take it. They could harm my kids physically — and I couldn't live with myself if that happened. To me, it just wasn't worth seeing my daughter live in fear of the vehicle getting vandalized at their school.\nI ended up taking it back, and Tesla was really cool about it. I was able to unwind everything.\nI think people should have the right to protest — but they should have the right to protest without destruction. That's where the lines have been crossed.\nRead more about Baker's story here.\nRelated stories\nBusiness Insider tells the innovative stories you want to know\nBusiness Insider tells the innovative stories you want to know\nI no longer align with Tesla, but I have no interest in taking down the company or selling my cars\nJohn VonBokel is a 45-year-old Tesla owner living near St. Louis, Missouri. Business Insider has verified his shareholder status.\nI have appreciated and admired Tesla for some time. I was under the impression that it aligned with my personal beliefs in terms of environment, which also overlaps with my personal political beliefs.\nNow I feel as though I was wrong all along, or something has changed — but I certainly don't feel like I align with the company and the brand anymore. The shift has been uncomfortable and difficult.\nAs of October last year, I had hundreds of Tesla shares, and I sold all of them in the last few months.\nMy decision to sell was primarily financial. After the election, the stock just started going up, and I couldn't figure out how Elon Musk and Trump being together was beneficial to Tesla — and certainly not to the degree that warranted its market capitalization to nearly double.\nFor me, that meant it was overvalued and I needed to cash out. But I'm under no illusion that selling my shares had any impact on Elon's personal wealth or are somehow a repudiation of his actions.\nI feel like what Elon Musk is doing politically is negatively impacting the brand and the company. But I'm more interested in protests that are focused on Elon Musk and Donald Trump's specific actions, or politics in general.\nThe name \"Tesla Takedown\" itself evokes something negative to me. They're trying to take down a company that I believe is still full of good people who just happen to be led by somebody I don't support anymore.\nWhile I'm not interested in taking down the company, I'm also not interested in supporting it.\nI drive a Tesla pretty much daily and haven't experienced vandalism, so I'm not worried about that. But I certainly would struggle to buy a new Tesla now.\nCoincidentally, though, they don't have anything that I really want. I have multiple Teslas that I'm happy with. I have test-driven the newer versions, but there aren't any improvements that make me want to get a new loan at current interest rates.\nThe future is difficult to predict. My decision to purchase another vehicle would depend partly on what they come out with.\nI've been laughed at for my Tesla, but I'm not deterred from buying another one\nMitchell Feldman is a Telsa owner living in the UK.\nI'm a gadget enthusiast, and I was drawn to buying a Tesla because it had all the things I wanted in a car. It was easy to use and environmentally friendly. I liked the idea of never having to go to a gas station again. The safety features, like assisted driving and situational awareness, also drew me.\nI bought my Model Y in 2022, and it's performed over and above my expectations.\nIn March, I experienced the first negative reaction to my Tesla since I've had the car. I went to a concert in London, and while I was in the parking lot, I saw a guy with his wife and daughter pointing at my car and laughing.\nThe guy came up to me in a very confrontational way and said, \"Do you support Elon Musk, then, driving a Tesla?\"\nI was quite aghast. I felt quite violated by the question and didn't know what to say.\nI've always admired Elon Musk because I think that a lot of the technology he creates is for betterment. I like that his businesses are data-driven, whether it's Neuralink, SpaceX, or Tesla.\nI hadn't considered the impact his work at DOGE was having on the US government; as someone based in the UK, I'm somewhat removed from what's happening. I think Trump has brought in someone who will look at the situation through the lens of a CEO.\nThe incident made me realize how the perception of Musk impacts his brands. It hasn't put me off from buying another Tesla, however. I'm hoping to have the new Model Y in a few months.\nEveryone is allowed an opinion, but I'm proud of the fact that I don't conform to the crowd and choose my personal preferences over listening to what everyone else says.\nRead more about Feldman's story here.\nI don't think people should make assumptions about my politics because I own a Tesla\nMichele Pierog, a 57-year-old Tesla owner from New Hampshire.\nI got myself a Tesla Model Y in 2023. I wanted something that was convenient, and I didn't think that any competitor brands had charging infrastructure as robust as Tesla's.\nI wanted to try out the car, but thought I'd probably sell it in two years. After three months of driving it, I was amazed by how much I enjoyed never having to go to a gas station.\nThe utility has been great. I often use its self-driving driving capabilities. There's plenty of room, and it has a \"frunk\" — a trunk and the front where I keep games for my granddaughter when we're traveling. We call it the \"frunk of fun.\"\nI'm not a huge news watcher, so I wasn't really aware of the Tesla controversy. I knew Elon Musk had been put in a position of power, and people weren't happy, but I wasn't aware this impacted Tesla drivers until a friend called me a couple of weeks ago. She asked how I felt about driving my Tesla.\nMy response was that nothing had changed for me. The utility of the car was the same.\nI did some research afterward and saw that there were protests at Tesla dealerships and some violent acts around Teslas. Regardless of what people's political views are about my vehicle, I think it's wrong that people are vandalizing Teslas.\nRecently, when I was driving my granddaughter, someone in a truck behind me drove up aggressively close to me and sandwiched me between them and the car in front. They started beeping and yelling at me. I don't know if this was because of my Tesla, but I assumed that it was because it coincided with media reporting of Tesla vandalism, and there aren't many other Teslas in my area.\nEven though this is speculative, I'm now wondering whether my vehicle choice is putting me in a bad position safety-wise.\nI don't yet feel unsafe enough to get rid of my Tesla, but it saddens me that I may have to make a decision about changing my car based on other people's perceptions.\nDriving a Tesla doesn't automatically mean I support what Elon is doing or have a particular political view. I don't think people should make assumptions about me because of the car I drive.\nDo you have a story to share about the anti-Tesla movement?

        "Elon Musk said he'd soon be pulling away from the White House's DOGE office to focus on Tesla.\nThough he's been known for his chainsaw approach to firing federal workers, deeper cuts are still to come.\nThe first round faced legal challenges, but DOGE has a path to making the next set of reductions stick.\nElon Musk said he's backing away from DOGE in May, but that doesn't mean the federal worker firings are over.\nIn fact, they're only heating up.\nWhile the first era of DOGE firings continues to face legal issues, the next set could be on stronger footing. That's because agencies have the chance to craft more methodical plans. In particular, many are offering buyout-like deferred resignation plans for workers to voluntarily quit in exchange for months ofpaid administrative leave.\nThese methods could prove to be on a more solid legal footing than the first round of firings, which focused on new or newly promoted workers, cited low performance ratings, and did not provide notice. It all means that the DOGE ethos is alive and well in the federal government, with or without Musk.\nHow round 2 of firings is different\nMusk and DOGE spent much of the last three months overseeing a wave of probationary federal workers. Those workers were at the start of their tenure in their new roles, including internal promotions. They have fewer protections than longer-serving federal employees.\nThat round of cuts saw several snafus because, rather than targeting specific programs, DOGE simply removed many people who had been working for less than a year or two. That led to scenarios like workers who handle the nuclear stockpile or study bird flu getting fired and then ultimately rehired. It also faced legal issues, with a judge ordering in March that those workers needed to be reinstated.\nGoing back to the drawing board with terminations means a chance to execute reduction-in-force plans, or RIFs, that follow proper procedures.\n\"I think probably the courts have done a huge favor to DOGE by putting people back in their office until they can do a more well-calculated RIF,\" Michele Evermore, a senior fellow at the left-leaning think tank the Century Foundation, said.\nThe White House and DOGE office did not immediately respond to a request for comment from BI.\nOver the past month, new RIFs have gone out. The Department of Education announced in March that it was terminating over 1,300 workers, slashing its workforce by 50%. The Small Business Administration said it would reduce its workforce by 43%.\nThe Department of Health and Human Services had already started terminating employees as part of its plan to slash 10,000 from its workforce.\nWhile the next round of reductions appears to be more targeted, it doesn't mean they're immune to litigation.\nFederal worker unions have vowed to fight back. Doreen Greenwald, president of the National Treasury Employees Union, said in a statement that the union would \"pursue every legal avenue to stop this unprecedented attack on the very foundation of our national government.\"\nIt's unclear if they'll have a case. David Super, an administrative law professor at Georgetown Law, said that the plans may vary by department, and some could be more vulnerable to legal challenges than others.\nHe added that it's \"entirely possible that those agencies work really, really carefully and produce correct RIF plans.\"\nFederal workers are getting the option to quit before they're fired\nIn lieu of RIFs, some agencies are choosing another acronym: DRPs. Deferred resignation programs are the next round of the \"Fork In The Road\" that offered employees early resignation earlier in the year, and might be an easier solution for those aiming to trim head count because workers voluntarily opt into them. Bloomberg reported, for instance, that nearly 20% of Department of Labor workers have opted for voluntary separation. Some Social Security Administration employees have also received a DRP.\nRelated stories\nBusiness Insider tells the innovative stories you want to know\nBusiness Insider tells the innovative stories you want to know\nTwo internal emails at the Internal Revenue Service, viewed by BI, said that over 10,000 agency employees applied for the second round of the deferred resignation program and that further reductions in force are coming.\nWhile DRPs might help the government shed workers, the payout could end up being less than the severance provided in a RIF, said Alan Lescht, an employment attorney specializing in federal workers.\n\"They're trotting this out to people who are being targeted for RIFs or could potentially be in a RIF. And for federal employees that are like that, the RIFs may actually provide a larger payout,\" Lescht said. And, opting into a DRP means workers are giving up rights to their positions — essentially, forfeiting the ability to be reinstated. He suggests workers take a \"deep dive\" into their job prospects before opting out.\n\"For many people, it may turn out that the best option is to stay and fight because the government has to satisfy a lot of requirements in order to justify a firing under the RIF rules,\" Lescht said. \"The RIF rules are very extensive and very complicated, and it's very likely that with the speed with which the government is moving, that they will make mistakes.\"\nHave a tip?

        "Elon Musk announced his plans to step back from DOGE to focus more on Tesla.\nBI spoke with 17 federal workers about what a possible Musk retreat would mean.\nSeveral said they hope they no longer have to send Musk's weekly \"What did you do last week\" email.\nElon Musk has said he stepping away from DOGE and the West Wing, but there's one thing federal workers really want to know.\n\"Can we stop sending this weekly email now?\" an employee at the Internal Revenue Service asked.\nBusiness Insider spoke to 17 federal workers after the Tesla CEO said on a Tuesday earnings call that he hopes to devote more time to the company because the \"major work of establishing\" DOGE is complete.\nSeveral federal workers brought up the \"What did you do last week\" email required by Musk's DOGE office since February. Many said they're skeptical that Musk will forfeit his White House influence. Even if he does, some said Musk's legacy will live on in DOGE through cuts to the federal workforce and government budget. Others are simply hopeful they'll have one less weekly email to send.\nAs a special government employee, Musk is only legally allowed to work for the Trump administration for 130 days a year. Still, the federal workers BI spoke with said they expect him to continue making political headlines.\n\"My reaction is, 'I'll believe it when I see it,'\" a programmer at the IRS said, adding, \"I believe the richest man in the world has hacked his way into the most powerful government in the world, and there is nobody to stop him from keeping that access, even if he looks 'gone' on paper.\"\nA former employee at the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration said that they aren't taking Musk's announcement seriously. An employee at the Office of Personnel Management added that Musk's vow to step back seems like \"PR spin.\"\nHave a tip?

Use a personal email address and a nonwork device; here’s our guide to sharing information securely.\nOther federal workers said that even if Musk does leave DOGE, his actions will have a lasting impact on the government and its staff.\n\"The effect he's had on the federal government can't be as neatly defined as quarterly earnings reports,\" the OPM employee said. Several workers expressed concern over reports that DOGE and Musk have access to sensitive information like internal government databases and Americans' Social Security details.\nSome talked about the anxiety that DOGE's federal firing spree has caused in their own lives. A few said they are constantly worried about losing their livelihoods. Federal workers who voted for Donald Trump and support his money-saving goals have previously told BI they felt betrayed by Musk's abrupt mass firings of what DOGE called \"low performers.\"\n\"There is a methodical way to downsize, and I'm all for right-sizing to meet current events,\" a Department of Agriculture employee said. \"The way Musk and his team have handled and are continuing to handle the situation is harmful to federal workers (who are real people with families), harmful to American institutions, and ultimately harmful to the American public.\"\nA Department of Defense employee hopes that Musk stepping back will give them \"a little relief\" about their job security.\nAnd then there are the possible effects on their day-to-day work. Several federal workers told BI they hope Musk's departure signals the end of his \"five bullets\" email. It's unclear what Musk and his colleagues do with the information or if it has led directly to any employee firings.\n\"I have to look and research and see what I did — that's 10 minutes that's wasted,\" one Social Security Administration employee said, adding, \"I could be spending my time more efficiently doing other things.\" Another IRS employee said they send nearly the same email every week.\nMusk said on Tuesday's Tesla call that he will still spend a day or two a week on government matters, \"as long as it is useful\" to the president. When reporters asked Trump in the Oval Office on Wednesday about Musk's departure, he said that Musk \"is an incredible guy\" and \"was a tremendous help both in the campaign and what he's done with DOGE.\" Neither Musk nor Trump elaborated on Musk's future role in the administration.\nThe possible DOGE shake-up comes alongside plummeting first-quarter Tesla earnings. The electric-vehicle company's earnings per share and revenue were down 71% and 9% year over year, respectively. Musk said last month that his role in the White House was \"costing me a lot\" and he was running his businesses with \"great difficulty.\" With news that he could be retreating from Trumpworld, Tesla's stock was trading up over 5% after hours and jumped again Wednesday.\nOne federal employee said they aren't surprised Musk is leaning back into his CEO role. They said working in the government is likely \"too much trouble for someone who is trained to see things as engineering problems.\"",

        "In a Wednesday court filing, Sam Altman's lawyers didn't pull their punches against Elon Musk.\nThe filing may be the most detailed account by Altman's side of the breakup between the tech titans.\nMusk \"has tried every tool available to harm OpenAI\" in his personal vendetta against the company, it reads.\nIf you let Sam Altman's lawyers tell it, Elon Musk's ongoing battle against OpenAI stems from his personal vendetta against Altman and OpenAI — a company that has seen its business boom since it refused to cede control to Musk in 2018.\nIn a Wednesday filing related to Musk's August 2024 lawsuit against OpenAI, lawyers for Altman and the company laid out Altman's version of events that led to the breakup between the two tech titans. It has been the most detailed account thus far of Altman's side of what went down in his fight with Musk.\n\"Musk could not tolerate seeing such success for an enterprise he had abandoned and declared doomed,\" the filing read. \"He made it his project to take down OpenAI, and to build a direct competitor that would seize the technological lead—not for humanity but for Elon Musk.\"\nThe filing continued: \"The ensuing campaign has been relentless. Through press attacks, malicious campaigns broadcast to Musk's more than 200 million followers on the social media platform he controls, a pretextual demand for corporate records, harassing legal claims, and a sham bid for OpenAI's assets, Musk has tried every tool available to harm OpenAI.\"\nOpenAI's filing on Wednesday came the same day the judge in the case set a March 2026 trial date in this clash of titans lawsuit. The company's lawyers did not respond to a request for comment from Business Insider.\nOpenAI said it was counter-suing Musk in a scathing series of X posts published on Wednesday. The ChatGPT maker also pointed to older blog posts it had published on their pivot from a nonprofit approach as well as their email exchanges with Musk.\n\"Elon's nonstop actions against us are just bad-faith tactics to slow down OpenAI and seize control of the leading AI innovations for his personal benefit,\" OpenAI wrote on X on Wednesday.\n\"Elon's never been about the mission. He's always had his own agenda. He tried to seize control of OpenAI and merge it with Tesla as a for-profit — his own emails prove it. When he didn't get his way, he stormed off,\" the company added.\nRepresentatives for OpenAI referred BI to its recent X posts and the Wednesday filing when contacted for comment.\nMusk cofounded OpenAI with Altman in 2015 but left the company's board in 2018. Musk said in 2019 that he left because Tesla was competing for the same talent as OpenAI. Musk said he also \"didn't agree with some of what the OpenAI team wanted to do. Musk did not specify what those differences were.\nSince then, the Tesla and SpaceX CEO has been a vocal critic of Altman's leadership of OpenAI. Musk had initially filed a lawsuit against OpenAI in February 2024 but withdrew it in June. He later refiled the lawsuit in August.\nIn his lawsuit, Musk accused OpenAI of violating its nonprofit mission by partnering with Microsoft. Musk's lawyers argued that OpenAI's executives \"deceived\" him into cofounding the company by playing on his fears about AI's existential risks.\nIn February, an Elon-Musk-led investor group made a $97.4 billion bid for OpenAI. Altman dismissed Musk's unsolicited takeover bid.\n\"The company is not for sale, neither is the mission,\" Altman said of Musk's bid in an interview with Sky News in February.\nMusk did not respond to a request for comment from BI.",
        "Tesla has lost its crown as the top EV seller in Europe.\nVolkswagen's EVs outsold Elon Musk's car company across the first three months of the year, according to data from JATO Dynamics, an automotive analysis firm.\n65,679 Volkswagen battery EVs were registered in the first quarter, compared to 53,237 Teslas.\nThe German carmaker saw its registrations more than double year-over-year, rising 157% since the first quarter of 2024.\nTesla registrations dropped 38% over the same period. According to JATO's data, this was the biggest decline among the top 30 most-registered brands.\nIt's a bad time for Tesla to be losing ground. JATO found that the year's first three months were the strongest quarter for battery EVs on record. Battery EVs accounted for 16.9% of all total car registrations in March — an increase of 2.7 percentage points year-over-year.\nThe UK was the main driver of growth, with volumes up by 13%.\nDespite the company losing the top spot overall, Tesla's Model Y and Model 3 remain the top two most-registered battery EVs.\nIn March, registrations of the former dropped 43%, but the Model 3 increased 1%. The Volkswagen ID.4 ranked third but remained 2,000 units short of the Model 3 across the quarter.\n\"As the brand continues to deal with a host of PR issues in addition to the changeover of the Model Y, Tesla is now relying on the Model 3 to offset its loses,\" said Felipe Munoz, a global analyst at JATO Dynamics.\n\"Despite the controversy surrounding the brand's CEO and the limited availability of the new Model Y, Tesla continues to perform well,\" he added.\nTesla reported first-quarter earnings on Tuesday, with revenue down 9% while net income plunged 64%, well below analyst expectations.\nHowever, the stock still rose, as Musk said he would spend less time working with the government and focus more on his car company.",
        "Some Tesla drivers allege that their odometers reflect significantly higher mileage than expected.\nA new class action suit says their mileage reads as much as 117% higher than it should.\nInaccurate readings could affect warranties, lease terms, and undermine claims about the car's range.\nA new class action lawsuit accuses Tesla of intentionally manipulating the mileage shown on its electric vehicles' odometers to more quickly void its warranties. Other Tesla drivers not involved in the litigation have told Business Insider they believe they've experienced the same phenomenon.\nAstonia Diaz, a Tesla owner in Las Vegas, said she first noticed something was wrong with her odometer reading about five months after she purchased a new Model Y for $60,000 in 2021.\nAs a remote worker, Diaz spends most of her time at home and uses her Tesla primarily to get groceries, visit the mall, and occasionally stop for fast food. When she realized shortly after purchase that her car had registered 7,000 miles on its odometer, she felt something was amiss.\n\"To get 7,000 miles in five months, I'd have to be driving about 1,400 miles each month,\" she told Business Insider. \"I may have driven half of that, or even less.\"\nDiaz isn't alone. Business Insider spoke to four other Tesla drivers who say they've also seen a significant difference between how much they say they drive and what shows up on the odometer.\nIt's unclear how many Tesla drivers have noticed a similar gap, how frequently it happens, or whether it constitutes a pattern. Social media sites, including the Tesla Motors Club forum, contain similar complaints dating back years.\nThe drivers who spoke to Business Insider said they worry about how an overactive odometer impacts their warranty, lease terms, and resale value.\nNyree Hinton, who lives in California, filed the class action lawsuit against the company on April 2, accusing Tesla of using algorithms and energy consumption metrics to manipulate and misrepresent the actual mileage traveled by Tesla vehicles.\nThe suit, which is being heard in California's Central District Court, says Hinton purchased a used 2020 Model Y with an odometer reading of 36,772 miles in December 2022, with a warranty valid through September 2024, \"or 50,000 miles, whichever came first.\" Over the next few months, the car had repeated suspension issues and a significant mileage difference compared to his daily driving habits, the lawsuit alleges.\n\"By Plaintiff's own calculations, his Tesla Vehicle consistently exhibited accelerated mileage accumulations of varying percentages ranging from 15 percent to 117 percent higher than Plaintiff's other vehicles and his driving history,\" the complaint says. No additional plaintiffs have been added to the suit.\nRepresentatives for Tesla and lawyers for Hinton did not immediately respond to requests for comment from Business Insider. The company has not commented publicly on the allegations in the suit but has denied all material allegations in court filings.\nAn artificially high reading could impact the validity of a mileage-based warranty, cost lessees extra money if they exceed a mileage limit set by their contract, or undermine a manufacturer's claims about its range.\nTesla says its vehicles can travel between 250 and 400 miles on a single charge, depending on the model and driving conditions. This is among the highest ranges for electric vehicles on the market. The company's Basic Vehicle Limited Warranty, which is transferable if the car is sold, covers its vehicles for up to four years or 50,000 miles, whichever comes first.\nHinton's Tesla's odometer reached 50,000 miles in July 2023, and his warranty was voided a full year sooner than expected. In the suit, he alleges that the mileage inconsistency he observed suddenly stopped as soon as his warranty was voided, even though the length of his commute increased around the same time.\nRelated stories\nBusiness Insider tells the innovative stories you want to know\nBusiness Insider tells the innovative stories you want to know\nA costly discrepancy\nA Model 3 driver from Minneapolis named Olivia, who requested anonymity, first noticed a variance about a year into her lease and began comparing her mileage on her phone's GPS to her car's odometer, according to records reviewed by Business Insider.\n\"I drive a 13.4-mile drive to and from work most days,\" Olivia said. \"It's the same distance on the phone and Tesla, but my odometer will typically add between two to eight extra miles, depending on the day.\"\nOlivia said she repeatedly tried to get her vehicle serviced to address the odometer inconsistency, but Tesla canceled her appointments.\nOlivia's lease allowed her to put 30,000 miles on her Tesla. But since her odometer read 50,000 miles when she went to return the vehicle in October 2024, the dealership said she would owe more than $5,000 in overage fees, she said. She said she pursued arbitration with Tesla over the bill but has not received a response from the company; they have stopped contacting her about the overage bill and have not put the charge on her credit report.\nThree other Tesla drivers told Business Insider they first began tracking their odometer readings because their mileage appeared to be between 20% and 80% higher than they expected based on their daily commute. Two people said the issue appeared to be resolved after a software update, but others, including Hinton and Diaz, didn't see improvement.\nDiaz said she noticed her Tesla seemed to be racking up miles faster than her old Chevy, which she had often used for long-distance trips within Sacramento and throughout Maryland, Washington, DC, and Arlington, Virginia. Diaz started tracking her mileage using MileIQ, an app she has used to map her driving each month since July 2023.\nScreenshots reviewed by Business Insider show that during the months she logged on the app, her monthly average mileage was 452. She drove the most in August 2023, with the app logging 708 miles.\nIf she drove 708 miles monthly, she would have expected to put 25,488 miles on her car in the first three years. However, screenshots reviewed by Business Insider showed that the odometer on her Model Y hit 48,728 miles by April 2024, butting up against her 50,000-mile warranty well before its four-year limit.\nDiaz said she did not take her Tesla to have the odometer looked at because she didn't think her inquiry would be taken seriously and believed she would be charged a fee to check it.\nIn the lawsuit, Hinton says he took his Tesla in for repairs on its suspension system and other parts on six occasions between December 2022 and June 2023. It is unclear from the complaint whether Hinton flagged the odometer reading. The lawsuit says Hinton was quoted over $10,000 for repairs after his warranty expired — repairs he claims should have been covered if the odometer had the correct reading.\nHinton's suit alleges that Tesla \"employs an odometer system that utilizes predictive algorithms, energy consumption metrics, and driver behavior multipliers that manipulate and misrepresent the actual mileage traveled by Tesla Vehicles.\"\n\"In so doing, Defendants can, and do, accelerate the rate of depreciation of the value of Tesla Vehicles and also the expiration of Tesla Vehicle warranties to reduce or avoid responsibility for contractually required repairs as well as increase the purchase of its extended warranty policy,\" the suit says.\nDepending on the model, a Tesla extended warranty agreement costs between $1,800 and $3,500, the trade publication Inside EVs said.\n\"These systemic inaccuracies and fraudulent business practices undermine the value of Tesla Vehicles and their warranties, erode consumer trust, and suggest intentional practices designed to financially benefit Tesla Inc. at the expense of its customers,\" Hinton's lawsuit says.\n\"In short, Tesla has thus misled, induced, and defrauded consumers from obtaining the benefits of Tesla Inc.'s warranties and into purchasing Tesla Vehicles and spending money on Tesla Inc.'s extended warranty packages, and thus harmed consumers through its fraudulent business practices, misrepresentations, and false advertising.\"\nRelated stories\nBusiness Insider tells the innovative stories you want to know\nBusiness Insider tells the innovative stories you want to know\nNot a new problem for Tesla\nOdometer complaints come as the automaker navigates an already shaky year.\nTesla stock is down more than 33% in 2025. It faces lawsuits and investigations, including a federal probe launched last year into whether Tesla committed wire fraud or securities fraud with exaggerated claims of self-driving, and a defamation lawsuit by a former engineer who says she lost her job after raising a safety concern in 2014.\nThe company has not publicly commented on the federal probe, which was first reported by Reuters in May 2024. The defamation lawsuit was forced into arbitration and later dismissed, but on April 14, a panel of appeal judges in California reversed the lower court's ruling, allowing the case to continue. In 2017, HuffPost, in a since-deleted article, reported that Tesla called the engineer's claims \"patently false, and frankly, completely nonsensical.\"\nTesla facilities recently faced attacks, vandalism, and protests in a backlash to CEO Elon Musk's political activities. Since Donald Trump took office in January, Musk has championed the administration's cost-cutting agenda with the Department of Government Efficiency, spearheading layoffs at agencies including Veterans Affairs and the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau.\nIn January 2023, in South Korea, antitrust regulators fined Tesla $2 million for false advertising after finding the company had overstated the vehicles' range in cold weather. While Tesla did not issue a public statement on the regulatory agency's findings, the carmaker changed the advertising on its Korean-language website in February 2022, after the Korean Federal Trade Commission launched its investigation, according to Bloomberg.\nA July 2023 Reuters report said that Tesla intentionally inflated its in-dash range projections, knowingly exaggerating the distance its vehicles can travel before their batteries run out, and incentivized staff members to cancel service appointments for drivers who raised the problem. Tesla has not publicly responded to the Reuters report.\nIn August 2023, Tesla was sued by EV owners who alleged it intentionally exaggerated how far the vehicles could drive on a single charge. The company has denied those claims, and a judge ruled in March 2024 that the dispute must go to arbitration.\nRead next",
        "Elon Musk said on Tuesday that Waymo robotaxis cost more money to build.\nThe Tesla CEO said his company has the upper hand because of its ability to scale quickly.\nEx-Waymo CEO John Krafcik told BI that Tesla still has a lot to prove.\nTesla CEO Elon Musk took multiple digs at Waymo, one of his biggest competitors in the robotaxi race, during Tuesday's earnings call.\nEx-Waymo CEO John Krafcik shot back: Check the scoreboard.\n\"Tesla has never competed with Waymo — they've never sold a robotaxi ride to a public rider, but they've sold a lot of cars,\" Krafcik said in an email to Business Insider. \"And although Tesla hopes to compete with Waymo someday, they've failed utterly and completely at this for each of the 10 years they've been talking about it.\"\nKrafick led Waymo between 2015 and 2021, overseeing the self-driving division's spin-off from Alphabet in 2016. He was replaced with two co-CEOs, Tekedra Mawakana and Dmitri Dolgov. Krafick now serves on the board of another EV maker, Rivian.\nTesla made another big push for its robotaxi bet during its latest earnings presentation.\nMusk said the initial \"pilot\" rollout in Austin in June would consist of 10 to 20 robotaxis using Tesla Model Ys. The ramp-up afterward will be quick, he said, predicting \"millions\" of fully autonomous Teslas on the road by the second half of next year and a market share domination of \"99% or something ridiculous.\"\nThe CEO sounded confident on the call about Tesla's approach to autonomy, which relies on cameras and a \"generalized\" AI that the company said would be able to adapt to various driving environments without the need for pre-mapping a particular region.\nWaymo vehicles operate differently.\nWaymo maps out a city like San Francisco or Tokyo with its cars before deploying a robotaxi service to the public, and it uses a generous set of lidar sensors and cameras.\nMusk has previously said that this approach is arduous and expensive, and he reiterated that point during the earnings call.\n\"The issue with Waymo's cars is it costs way more money,\" Musk said, making a play on Waymo's name. \"Rim shot.\"\nHe later added: \"Waymo decided that an expensive sensor suite was the way to go, even though Google's very good at AI. It's ironic.\"\nMusk estimated that Tesla could make robotaxis that cost a \"quarter to 20%\" less than the cost of Waymo's Jaguar I-Pace vehicles — and it would do so at higher volumes through its unique manufacturing methods.\nKrafcik thinks the cost talk is a moot point when considering safety.\nIn the long run, the cost of sensors has a \"trivial cost-per-mile impact over the useful life of a robotaxi,\" he told BI, \"while also providing massive quantifiable safety benefits.\"\n'Undelivered promises'\nTesla's robotaxi vision hinges on a key piece of technology it calls Full Self-Driving, which is powered by the company's own hardware stack.\nRelated stories\nBusiness Insider tells the innovative stories you want to know\nBusiness Insider tells the innovative stories you want to know\nTo date, the company has not rolled out a public version of the software that operates without the supervision of a human driver.\nOn Wednesday, the company shared a post on X, previewing the robotaxi app and service in Silicon Valley. Tesla said in the post that the company has completed over 1,500 trips and 15,000 miles of driving.\nThe video showed a person hailing a Model Y. One scene showed a safety operator sitting behind the wheel.\nTom Narayan, an analyst at RBC Capital Markets, said in his latest forecast that Tesla could generate $80 billion in robotaxi revenue a year in the US by 2040.\nKrafcik is skeptical.\n\"Well, after 10 years of undelivered promises, it seems pretty rational for those watching to be data- and evidence-driven,\" he said. \"There's still a lot of promises, still no Tesla liability for FSD driving performance, and still no universal robotaxi service.\"\nThe former CEO acknowledged that Tesla's FSD has improved, but he said that that's different from showing that the company has a safe, \"truly autonomous\" robotaxi service.\nTesla and Waymo did not respond to a request for comment.",
        "Tesla has said its robotaxi launch in Austin, Texas, will take place in June.\nThe company has about 300 test operators and has worked to built up \"critical miles.\"\nIt also rolled out a test version of its robotaxi app to Autopilot engineers and held an event with local first responders.\nTesla is racing toward its planned robotaxi debut in June, with hundreds of test drivers quietly laying the groundwork across Austin.\nOver the past few months, about 300 Tesla test operators have been driving through the city's streets around the clock using prototypes of the company's self-driving software as a part of the program the company internally calls \"Project Rodeo.\"\nIn the months leading up to the launch, Tesla has held a training event with local first responders, worked to build up \"critical miles,\" formed a team of remote operators, and rolled out a test version of its robotaxi app to Autopilot engineers in Austin and San Francisco.\nThe carmaker has used test drivers to hone its advanced driver-assist software since at least 2016, but Tesla has intensified its efforts over the past year, four current and former workers told Business Insider.\nDuring Tesla's layoffs in April 2024, it eliminated several test drivers and moved Project Rodeo from general vehicle testing to the Autopilot department under Ashok Elluswamy, its vice president of AI software, three people with knowledge of the situation told BI.\nSince then, the intensity of the program has increased substantially, and many workers have shifted from updating Tesla's Full Self-Driving system to robotaxi development, two people said.\nA looming deadline\nInternally, Tesla has set a June 1 deadline for the launch, insiders said, and Musk has been told during weekly Autopilot meetings with Elluswamy's team that the company is on track to hit it.\nWorkers said they had not received details about the event or what it would entail.\nPublicly, it has provided a handful of details. On Tesla's earnings call Tuesday, Musk said Austin residents would be able to pay to ride in a self-driving Model Y. He estimated that the program would launch with 10 to 20 cars.\n\"It feels very forced,\" a former worker said. \"It's this breakthrough moment for Tesla, but there is also this feeling of so many last-minute details being up in the air.\"\nOne worker described the June 1 deadline as more \"aspirational\" or \"motivational.\"\n\"A June 1 deadline makes a June 30 launch more likely,\" they said.\nTesla has not publicly announced a precise date for the event beyond \"June.\" The company did not respond to a request for comment.\nKey hurdles\nThe former employee said hitting a June 1 deadline presents challenges due to the difficulty of logging critical miles — testing done in complex or high-risk driving situations, such as navigating heavy traffic, handling unprotected left turns, or responding to sudden obstacles.\nThese scenarios are crucial for evaluating whether the self-driving system can handle edge cases without human intervention.\nTest drivers who spoke with BI described the testing process involved in accumulating critical miles. Tesla assigns test drivers to specialized testing routes, including \"critical\" tracks, where they're encouraged to avoid intervening, and \"adversarial\" tracks, which simulate emergency scenarios like reentering traffic from a roadside stop.\nElluswamy said during the earnings call that it's \"super rare\" to get critical interventions and that test drivers can go days without an intervention.\n\"You can't easily know whether you are improving or regressing in your capacity\" with the autonomous software, he said.\nTesla has also been working with local emergency services, documents obtained by BI show. The company met with the city's autonomous vehicle task force, which includes members of the Austin Fire Department, in December. It first reached out in spring 2024, documents show.\nIn March, Tesla performed about six hours of testing with local first responders, including members of the police and fire departments, at a closed testing track, one former worker said. About 60 drivers were split between Tesla test vehicles and personal vehicles in order to mimic normal traffic scenarios, the person said.\nA spokesperson from the Austin Police Department confirmed that Tesla held a testing day with first responders from Austin, Williamson County, and the Texas Department of Public Safety.\nRepresentatives for the Austin Fire Department and the autonomous vehicle task force did not respond to a request for comment.\nEngineers are testing out the robotaxi app\nTesla has begun demoing its robotaxi app with employees. The carmaker released an Apple TestFlight version to engineers earlier this year.\nIt was released in Austin and the San Francisco Bay Area. It allows Tesla employees to get free rides within a geofenced region, a virtual area that denotes where the vehicle can safely operate, two people said. In Austin, the robotaxi service is set to roll out across such an area, a person with knowledge of the program said.\nThe demo program features a safety driver who sits in the driver's seat and can take over when needed. There has been some discussion around using remote operators as safety drivers for the public rollout, two people familiar with the matter said. The workers operate in a designated facility in California with remote controllers, one person said.\nThe company has moved some test drivers into remote operator roles, two people said. Tesla had remote operators on deck during its robotaxi event in October; the workers are told to take over only in the event of an emergency, much like Waymo's or Zoox's remote operators, they said.\nWhile Austin and San Francisco remain high-priority testing areas, Tesla employs test drivers across other cities, including New York, Phoenix, Seattle, and Atlanta. Musk has said the self-driving cars will roll out to other cities over the course of the year.\nFor now, Austin is the key stomping ground for Tesla test drivers.\n\"There's just always a convoy of Teslas just going all over to Austin in circles,\" Musk said Tuesday. \"It's going to look pretty bizarre.\"\nDo you work for Tesla or have a tip?

        "Looks like Tesla needs to watch its back. Longbow, a U.K.-based startup, will release \"featherweight\" electric sports cars that you can ride in style without worrying so much about your carbon footprint.\nThe company was founded by Jenny Keisu, Daniel Davey, and Mark Tapscott, two of whom are Tesla alumni.\nDavey, per his LinkedIn, \"had two stints at Tesla commercialising the Roadster and then scaling with the Model 3.\" Tapscott worked at Tesla for seven years, where he successfully launched products and said he \"got shouted at by Elon (a lot).\"\nThey have developed two models, the Speedster and the Roadster, which are set to be released next year. So far, only U.K. customers can make reservations.\nThe Speedster, which is scheduled to be released first, costs over $110,000. Only 150 models will be made, making it the more exclusive of the two.\nThe Roadster is a bit cheaper, at around $84,000. A set number of models hasn't been announced yet, though Longbow has hinted at a much larger production scale.

        "Suzanne Cordeiro/AFP via Getty Images\nTwo of President Trump's key advisors are currently in a rather astonishing and public feud, with tariff-loving Peter Navarro and tariff-skeptical Elon Musk trading insults.\nOn Monday, on CNBC, Navarro said that Musk \"isn't a car manufacturer — he's a car assembler,\" suggesting that Tesla puts together vehicles composed of foreign-made parts. Musk opposes tariffs, Navarro said, because \"he wants the cheap foreign parts and we understand that.\"\nMusk hit back on his social media platform X on Tuesday, writing, \"Navarro is truly a moron. What he says here is demonstrably false.\" Also: \"Tesla has the most American-made cars. Navarro is dumber than a sack of bricks.\"\n\"Boys will be boys,\" the White House press secretary said of this altercation. (Peter Navarro is 75. Musk is 53.)\nThere's a lot going on there, most of which is far beyond the remit of a car reporter to explain. But inside this feud there is an actual, factual dispute — and Musk is pretty much right.\nTesla is — rather famously — significantly more vertically integrated than most modern automakers. That means that instead of relying on a network of suppliers for vehicle materials and components, the company does as much as it can in-house. The company does still use some third-party suppliers. But it builds its own batteries, for instance, and has gone as far as building an in-house lithium refinery for its battery raw materials.\nThere was one Tesla that you could fairly describe as having been \"assembled\" rather than manufactured: the original Tesla Roadster. That was, indeed, built from off-the-shelf parts — but Tesla quickly shifted away from that approach. Production ended in 2012.\nBut what about Navarro's broader critique, that Musk's tariff opposition is born from self-interest?\nIt's true that tariffs on car parts are expected to be wildly disruptive to the auto industry, if they remain in place long-term. But analysts think Tesla will be hurt less than any of its rivals. Analysts at the investment firm Bernstein are projecting a less than 5% impact to Tesla's gross profit margins, compared to 10-20% for most automakers.\nSome more numbers: According to government data, compiled so cars can be labeled based on how \"Made in America\" their parts are, for model year 2025, 75% of the parts for Tesla's Model 3 Long Range, by value, are sourced from the U.S. or Canada. That put it in the #2 slot for the most American-made parts on the list, which is compiled by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration.\n(And yes, for \"made-in-America\" labeling purposes, the government lumps Canada together with the U.S., which is a little inconvenient. Consider it a sign of just how close the trade relationship was … until recently. Canada, too, now faces steep tariffs on some goods.)\nAnd — in a much more readable format than a government spreadsheet — the Model Y tops the Cars.com \"Made in America\" index, which weighs the NHTSA parts data and plant locations, among other factors.\nNavarro is correct that some made-in-America vehicles are less made-in-America than others. \"This business model where BMW and Mercedes come into Spartanburg, S.C., and have us assemble German engines and Austrian transmissions, that doesn't work for America,\" he said in that same CNBC interview.\nIndeed, some vehicles are assembled in the U.S. using engines and transmissions from Europe or Asia. Teslas just aren't among them. (Not to mention that Teslas don't have engines or transmissions, because they're electric.)\nOverall, the companies that rely the most on American parts might surprise you. Despite being based in Japan, Honda is right up there with Tesla in terms of using American-made parts at its U.S. plants; its production is highly localized. GM and Ford, while iconic American brands, rank lower.\nAnd who does NHTSA list #1 for using made-in-America parts? The top vehicle is the Kia EV6 — made by a subsidiary of Hyundai, which is based in South Korea.",
        "The billionaire spent at least $20 million on a failed Wisconsin candidate.\nTesla reported poor sales numbers, but its stock surged after a report said he may step back from DOGE.\nElon Musk has had a roller coaster of a day.\nOn Tuesday night, Musk's favored conservative candidate failed to win a Wisconsin Supreme Court election despite the billionaire and his super PAC dropping at least $15.5 million on the race.\nOn Wednesday morning, Musk received more bad news. Tesla reported first-quarter deliveries were well below analysts' estimates. Shares in Musk's signature company are down roughly 30% this year.\nMusk chose this path himself. He has enthusiastically touted the White House DOGE office, even as polling has indicated his popularity has plummeted. In Wisconsin, polling found that Musk was more unpopular among Republicans than President Donald Trump.\nBut somewhat remarkably, the double whammy of bad news preceded a win for Musk. A report from Politico, citing three unnamed Trump insiders, said the president's inner circle was preparing for Musk to step back from his role at the White House. Tesla's stock bounced back from early losses and ended the day up 5%.\nThe White House later disputed Politico's report.\n\"This 'scoop' is garbage,\" White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt said. \"Elon Musk and President Trump have both publicly stated that Elon will depart from public service as a special government employee when his incredible work at DOGE is complete.\"\nDemocrats hammered Musk throughout the Wisconsin race. He decided to go to the state directly, wearing a Cheesehead hat in Green Bay and mugging for the cameras as he handed out millions in giveaways to supporters. (Musk first said the $1 million checks were for voters but then said they were for select Wisconsinites that his political organization wanted as spokespeople.)\nThe Tesla CEO also chose to join Trump's administration, juggling the responsibilities of leading his automaker, SpaceX, and xAI. Initially, it was thought that Musk would co-lead Trump's \"Department of Government Efficiency\" outside the government.\nIt didn't take long for his proximity to Trump to blow back on his companies, namely Tesla. There have been protests at Tesla dealerships around the globe. Some protesters have resorted to violence, with one accused of firebombing a Tesla dealership.\nWednesday's delivery numbers seemed to confirm fears that Musk's unpopularity is actively harming his flagship company. Tesla reported a 13% decline in deliveries in the first quarter compared with last year.\n\"The Street and us knew a bad 1Q was coming but this was even worse than expected,\" the Wedbush analyst Dan Ives, a major Tesla cheerleader, wrote Wednesday morning on X. \"The time has come for Musk ... it's a fork in the road moment.\"\nMusk has seen worse\nMusk has said that Tesla was on the verge of bankruptcy multiple times, including during the Model 3 ramp-up. He also briefly relinquished his title as the world's richest man early in 2024. Musk then reclaimed the title and saw his wealth skyrocket after the presidential election.\nRelated stories\nBusiness Insider tells the innovative stories you want to know\nBusiness Insider tells the innovative stories you want to know\nSo far, Musk has not shown a desire to change course. He's urged authorities to go after people he's labeled domestic terrorists who are attacking Tesla dealerships. Musk has also continued to speak in grandiose terms about his political positions — not exactly the words of someone about to trim his sails.\nBefore polls closed in Wisconsin on Tuesday, Musk said on an X Space that the state Supreme Court election was about \"the future of the world\" and maybe even \"Western civilization.\"\nMusk told Fox News that the race was so close that \"it may be decided by half a percent or a percent,\" maybe even a single person.\nJudge Brad Schimel, the Musk-endorsed candidate, is on track to lose by 10 percentage points.\nanalysis\nElon Musk\nRepublican Party\nMore\nRead next",
        "In the high desert 25 miles east of Reno, Gooseberry Mine is etched into the dusty Nevada hills. Until 1990, gold was dug out of the ground here. Now it's mostly abandoned.\nIn late March, I stood a few hundred yards away in a makeshift chemistry lab few people have been allowed to enter. My tour guide, Adam Kirby, a project manager at Redwood Materials, held up a small capsule containing dark powder.\n\"Black gold,\" he said, smiling.\nThe substance is known as Cathode Active Material, or CAM, a combination of metals and minerals that makes up roughly 60% of the value of EV batteries and 15% of the entire price of an electric vehicle.\nOil is the original black gold, of course. This has powered automobiles for a century. Now, though, EVs are steadily replacing the internal combustion engine with what Tesla and the rest of the industry hope is a more sustainable alternative.\nFor this to really happen, we must recycle the big battery packs inside all these EVs. Redwood Materials, run by Tesla cofounder JB Straubel, is building North America's biggest battery recycling operation. And CAM is the company's next big bet.\nEmily Najera for BI\nStraubel has been hacking away at this problem for almost a decade. Since Redwood was founded in 2017, the startup has raised about $2 billion from big investors, including Fidelity, Goldman Sachs, Baillie Gifford, and Amazon.\nToday, Redwood recycles more than 70% of all the lithium-ion batteries in North America. If you've ever handed old laptops or smartphones to a recycling center in the US or Canada, it's likely they ended up on a giant lot in front of Redwood Materials' 300 acre desert campus.\nThe company carefully heats these old batteries to just the right temperature to tease out the base ingredients, which include nickel, manganese, cobalt, and lithium. By themselves, these metals are valuable and Redwood has generated hundreds of millions of dollars in revenue by selling this raw material into the EV supply chain.\nThe next step for the company is combining this into CAM, which is a lot more valuable. Hence the name: new black gold. Instead of digging it up, Redwood conjures it into being through chemistry at industrial scale.\nIt's an expensive and technically complex bet for Redwood, Straubel, and his investors. While driving down from the lab with Kirby, the project manager, we passed a building under construction that was so huge it made the nearby earth-moving trucks look like toys. This will house most of the full-scale CAM production process, featuring a heated conveyor belt more than 150 feet long.\n\"Things like Redwood are multibillion-dollar capex, ambitious projects. You must back people with experience and gravitas who can execute,\" said Chris Evdaimon, an investment manager at Baillie Gifford, who also visited the site recently.\n\"To raise equity and debt, while having the trust of governments,\" he added, \"not many people can pull this off.\"\n\"Infinitely recyclable\"\nWhen I got back down the hill, I was ushered into the main Redwood office building on campus and met Chief Commercial Officer Cal Lankton in the \"Nickel\" office (next to the \"Manganese\" and \"Lithium\" rooms, of course).\nHe recounted how Redwood got started through a surprising revelation: The ingredients of lithium-ion batteries can be reused over and over. Unlike the original black gold, these materials don't go up in smoke or wear out.\n\"That was the foresight on JB's part,\" Lankton said. \"That's what differentiates this automotive transformation from previous ones — the batteries themselves are infinitely recyclable.\"\nRedwood's processes can now recover about 98% of the critical minerals from batteries. The problem is that once this stuff has been salvaged, it must be shipped overseas, mainly to China, where it's refined and combined into useful products such as CAM.\nBy the time this material goes into a new battery cell in a US gigafactory, it has traveled roughly 50,000 miles from being shipped to Asia and then back again, according to Baillie Gifford's Evdaimon.\nThat's massively inefficient. If the US and Europe really want to meet lofty goals such as having half of cars being electric by 2030, a homegrown industry is needed. \"Redwood Materials is essential for this,\" Evdaimon added.\nRedwood's circle\nRedwood's solution is what Lankton calls a \"circular battery value chain,\" and he says no one is doing this at scale yet in the Western world.\nRelated stories\nBusiness Insider tells the innovative stories you want to know\nBusiness Insider tells the innovative stories you want to know\nThe start of Redwood's circle begins with getting as many used batteries as possible. This includes production scrap from gigafactories, such as the ones Panasonic runs to supply Tesla, but also many other sources.\nRedwood has massively expanded the number of ways it gets old batteries via contracts with companies such as Toyota, VW, Ford, GM, Amazon, and BMW. Redwood often pays to access this supply, betting it can make more money by turning this unwanted, hazardous scrap into the new black gold.\nWhen you walk into Redwood Materials' high desert office in Nevada, there's even a black letterbox where visitors and staff can drop off old laptops and phones — or anything else that has a rechargeable battery.\nThe company now handles more than 20 gigawatt hours worth of lithium-ion batteries a year, the equivalent of almost 1.6 billion cellphones.\nA dusty lot\nThe result is a dusty lot full of batteries in front of the Redwood office that stretches halfway to the horizon. Kirby drove me around to see the different types of batteries arranged in squares with gaps of a few yards to prevent runaway fires.\nSome of these batteries still have a charge, so they must sit outside to shed this remaining electricity so they're safe to process.\nI wanted to snap photos, but Kirby said no up-close pics. Some partners don't want their old gear exposed to the public like this. Although, I did see a battery from a Hummer EV that was so big it took up a sizable portion of one storage square.\nA Rube Goldberg machine\nThen, we drove up the hill through Redwood's campus to near the top. There, batteries are carefully heated up to release the minerals and metals.\nSome volatile organic compounds are released by this part of the process. These and other unwanted by-products are processed through a winding maze of giant tubes and collected and cleaned with what are essentially huge HEPA filters, according to Kirby. It looked like a giant Rube Goldberg machine, sparkling in the desert sun.\nEmily Najera for BI\nKirby said some other battery recycling companies don't spend much time or money on this painstaking step, making their facilities less environmentally friendly.\nNext, a hydrometallurgy process refines and purifies the metals, minerals, and chemicals that are needed for CAM.\n\"Redwood's equipment was bought from other places, but they have made many adjustments. This is truly novel,\" said Baillie Gifford's Evdaimon. \"There are a hundred small things they've done to tweak and upgrade, and collectively, this makes Redwood the most efficient and innovative recycler for this industry in the Western world.\"\n1.3 million EVs a year\nOnce these ingredients have been isolated, they would typically be shipped to Asia. Starting in early 2026, Redwood will instead combine them into CAM inside the massive white campus building that's being finished as I write this. (There's enough space to build several more of these facilities on site, depending on how Redwood's big bet goes).\nRedwood estimates that North America will need 12 million tonnes of CAM by 2030, none of which is currently produced at commercial scale outside of China, Korea, and Japan. The company expects to be the first in North America.\nIn the coming years, Redwood aims to churn out 100 gigawatt hours worth of CAM per year. That would enable production of enough batteries to power 1.3 million EVs annually.\n\"What's beautiful about this business: So many partners and plants will take anything that Redwood makes right now. These ingredients are already in demand,\" said Evdaimon. \"And the more processes you add up the value chain, the more valuable your product gets and the better the profit margins are. There are a lot of processes that Redwood is adding.\"\nMaking this stuff well is hard\nReclaiming nickel, cobalt and other battery ingredients, rather than digging up virgin material from dirty, dangerous mines, is a heck of a lot more efficient. According to Redwood Materials, it uses 80% less energy, generates 70% fewer CO2 emissions, and requires 80% less water.\nRelated stories\nBusiness Insider tells the innovative stories you want to know\nBusiness Insider tells the innovative stories you want to know\nActually making good CAM, though — up to the high specifications of battery manufacturers — is really hard.\nYou must get just the right combination of nickel, manganese, cobalt, and lithium, along with tiny amounts of rare-earth minerals and other ingredients. That forms a lattice structure that has to be strong but also allows the free movement of lithium ions back and forth between the battery's cathode and anode as it charges and discharges electricity.\n\"At the end, it literally looks like a black powder that we put in big plastic bags and ship to the customer,\" Lankton said. \"But the work that goes into making this is incredibly technical.\"\nThree stages\nThere are three stages of Redwood's CAM journey. The first is the lab that I was allowed into. This is where the core chemical processes are devised and tested on a small scale.\nNearby is a demonstration plant that is a scaled-down version of Redwood's ultimate facility. Here, the company operates the same equipment and processes, such as rotating kilns, to prove its CAM production methods work consistently.\nThe final stage is doing all this on a massive scale in the giant CAM building down the hill from the lab and demo plant.\nEmily Najera for BI\n\"We're in that middle phase, but we've derisked a lot of that final step,\" Lankton told me. \"That's why we have a high degree of confidence in our ability to achieve our targets.\"\nSo confident, in fact, that Redwood already has multibillion-dollar contractual offtake agreements with Toyota and Panasonic for its CAM.\nCopper foil and Northvolt\nThis endeavor is not just technically complex, though. There are other risks when you're competing with China's manufacturing might.\nRedwood used to make copper foil, too, which is the main ingredient for the anode in batteries. However, Chinese companies began churning this out in massive quantities, and prices plummeted.\nLankton said blood, sweat, and quite a bit of capital went into the copper foil business, and he credited Straubel with the ability to make the painful decision to pause this part of the business.\n\"That is, perhaps, a point of pride to differentiate us from our peers,\" Lankton added. \"We're not dogmatic; we're not going to take a business plan and just do it until we think it works and run ourselves into the ground.\"\nIn March, Northvolt, a European battery recycling startup, went bankrupt after chewing through $15 billion in funding.\nLankton said he admired Northvolt's ambitious plans but said the company may have gone too far by trying to make full batteries itself rather than being just a supplier of materials like Redwood.\nTariff timing\nWhile Northvolt's demise paints a dour picture for battery recycling, other factors may be playing into Redwood's hands.\nThe Inflation Reduction Act from 2022 has big incentives for US battery production. And this year, Donald Trump's tariff barrage favors domestic manufacturing.\nBeing the first major CAM producer in the US is looking like a well-timed initiative right now. But Lankton said Redwood isn't resting on its laurels.\n\"Why should someone want to buy Redwood's CAM?\" he asked me, rhetorically, in the company's Nickel office.\nFirstly, Redwood has to be competitive on price globally, irrespective of incentives, tariffs, or other artificial factors.\nSecond, the company must have the technical prowess to pull this off. \"There's hardcore particle engineering that goes into this CAM,\" Lankton explained. \"It has to be consistent with anything else one of our customers can buy. So we have to technically meet or exceed those specifications.\"\nThen, finally, he conceded that there is value in having a reliable, sustainable, secure US source of battery material as questions swirl about the future of global trade.\n\"But if number one and number two aren't true, no one's gonna buy Redwood's CAM,\" he warned.\nRelated stories\nBusiness Insider\nBusiness Insider tells the innovative stories you want to know\nBusiness Insider\nBusiness Insider tells the innovative stories you want to know\nBusiness Insider\nBusiness Insider tells the innovative stories you want to know\nMore from Tech\nMost popular",

        "Tesla is dramatically accelerating its Semi truck ambitions, hiring more than 1,000 new factory workers in Nevada as the company races to fulfill years of production promises for its electric big rig, according to three people familiar with the matter.\nThe carmaker has brought the new workers into the Giga Sparks factory for training and tours over the past few months. Until recently, the company had fewer than 100 factory workers assigned to the truck, including at its pilot line in California, two people said.\nThe increase in hiring coincides with Tesla opening an extension at the Nevada Gigafactory purely for Semi production.\nOn its website, Tesla lists more than 80 manufacturing roles for the development of the Semi, from test and service technician roles to engineering and quality assurance positions.\nA spokesperson for Tesla did not respond to a request for comment.\nThe company released a video update on Monday saying that it had finished building the factory and was beginning to set up production lines.\nElon Musk first unveiled the Tesla Semi in 2017 and estimated that the truck would go into mass production in 2019. Tesla delivered its first Semi in December 2022 to PepsiCo, which placed an order for 100 trucks back in 2017. Musk said at the time that production would reach 50,000 units in 2024. UPS, Walmart, and Costco have also placed orders for the truck.\nMore recently, in 2023, Tesla announced it would build a designated Semi truck factory in Nevada.

        "The Porsche Panamera Turbo E-Hybrid is a high-performance plug-in hybrid super sedan.\nI was impressed by its hybrid V8 powertrain, cool cabin tech, and incredible driving.\nUnfortunately, supercar performance comes with supercar prices.\nSince its debut in 2010, the Porsche Panamera has developed into a segment leader that has helped spawn rivals like the Mercedes-AMG GT 4-door and even EV competitors like the Tesla Model S and Lucid Air.\nThe third-generation Panamera, launched in 2024, really wowed me thanks to its exceptional plug-in hybrid drivetrain and one of the most impressive active suspension systems I've ever experienced.\nIt's like four cars in one: the power of a sports car, the comforts of a luxury sedan, the practicality of an SUV, and enough EV range to get around town.\nI recently spent a week driving the 2025 Porsche Panamera Turbo E-Hybrid, which starts at $195,700.\nThe base V6 Panamera starts at around $103,000, while the range-topping Turbo S E-Hybrid requires an eye-watering $226,500.\nShipping fees and a slew of performance and luxury options pushed the as-tested price of my test car to nearly $235,000.\nPorsche has fine-tuned the Panamera's signature rear end from an upright hearse-like look to a design that feels sleeker and more elegant without compromising headroom.\nUpfront, the biggest change was the new LED Matrix headlights, which automatically adjust illumination based on navigation data, vehicle speed, and the front-facing camera to avoid blinding oncoming drivers.\nThe Panamera comes with a deployable three-piece spoiler.\nThe spoiler will automatically deploy at highway speeds, or you can manually trigger it.\nThe Panamera Turbo E-Hybrid is a big sedan: 16.6 feet long, and weighing at a hefty 5,300 lbs.\nIt's roughly the same size and weight as the rival Mercedes-AMG GT G3 S E Performance Four-Door Coupe but a whopping 800 lbs heavier than the non-hybrid BMW M8 Competition Gran Coupe.\nThe Panamera can be had with a six or eight-cylinder engine and as a hybrid.\nThe Panamera Turbo E-Hybrid is powered by a 512-horsepower, 4.0-liter, twin-turbocharged V8 engine paired with a 187-horsepower electric motor and a 25.9 kWh battery pack. Together, they produce 670 total system horsepower and 685 lb-ft of torque.\nThe most powerful variant, the Turbo S, squeezes another 100 total horsepower out of the same powertrain.\nMy Turbo E-Hybrid test car boasted fuel economy ratings of 19 mpg in combined driving when using only the V8 and 54 mpg when the hybrid system is factored in. The Porsche is rated for 28 miles of all-electric range, but I was able to get roughly 50 miles with the battery fully charged.\nThe 25.9 kWh battery pack can fully charge in 3.3 hours using a level-2 charger.\nUnfortunately, the Panamera does not accept DC fast charging.\nThe Panamera Turbo E-Hybrid's handling defies the laws of physics.\nIt's a big luxury sedan that drives like a focused four-door sports car with highly precise steering and beautifully balanced handling.\nA slew of tech, from torque vectoring to rear-axle steering, work in concert to give the 5,300-lb hybrid the nimbleness a car of its heft should not possess, effectively defying physics.\nThe standout piece of new tech is Porsche Active Ride, an electromechanical active suspension system that uses computer-controlled hydraulic dampers at each wheel to counteract body roll and improve traction in corners.\nOff the line, the twin-turbo V8 hybrid drivetrain works seamlessly with the crisp-shifting PDK transmission. The V8 emits a pleasing rumble as it catapults you to highway speeds in the blink of an eye.\nAccording to Porsche, the Turbo E-Hybrid does 0-60 in a brisk 3.0 seconds, but my experience launching supercars off the line tells me that figure is very conservative. Its top speed is 196 mph.\nThe interior of the Panamera is minimalistic to the extreme.\nThe new dash-mounted toggle shifter from the 918 hypercar declutters the center console.\nButtons have been removed in favor of capacitive touch controls, which work better here than on many of its rivals but aren't perfect.\nThere are screens galore, with the option of a 10.9-inch screen in front of the passenger in addition to the instrument display and central infotainment screen.\nOverall, the cabin works as efficiently as intended, with all of the most commonly used features and controls, all easily accessible.\nThe center stack 10.9-inch touchscreen is the focal point of the PCM infotainment system\nPCM is an excellent infotainment system. It's responsive, easy to use, and packed with features like digitally controlled air vents and video streaming.\nApple CarPlay and Android Auto are also standard.\nThe turbo-branded 18-way power front seats proved to be incredibly comfortable and supportive.\nThe Kalahari Grey leather seats are heated and ventilated and can be optioned with a massage function.\nThe rear cabin in my test car features two individual bucket seats instead of a traditional bench seat.\nThe rear cabin is relatively tight on space compared to traditional rivals like the Mercedes S-Class and BMW 7-Series, but it is on par with swoopy coupe competitors like the AMG GT 4-Door.\nBehind the passenger cabin is a moderately sized trunk.\nDespite having a chunk of its cargo room taken up by the charging cables, the space is surprisingly practical and, thanks to its hatchback design, capable of holding up to 44.3 cubic feet of cargo when the seats are folded.\nMy verdict: The Porsche Panamera Turbo E-Hybrid delivers performance, luxury, practicality, and EV range all in one package.\nThese days, the fastest-accelerating luxury sedans tend to be EVs like the Tesla Model S Plaid or even Porsche's own Taycan.\nHowever fast the EVs get, they simply can't match the drama and presence of a finely turned V8 Porsche. It's a reminder that the journey to your destination matters as much as getting there.\nBut the Panamera is much more than just fast in a straight line.\nIt combines the power and handling prowess of a Porsche sports car with the comforts of a German luxury sedan, the practicality of an SUV, and enough EV range to get around town without using any fuel.\nSo it's, in effect, four different cars wrapped up in one.\nTo me, that $235,000 price tag makes a lot more sense now.\nRead next",
        "Tesla is reducing Cybertruck production and reallocating some staff to Model Y lines, workers say.\nIt has delivered fewer than 50,000 Cybertrucks, a March 20 recall filing said.\nTesla started moving some workers off Cybertruck production in December.\nTesla is scaling back Cybertruck production.\nThe electric car maker has dropped production targets for several Cybertruck lines over the past few months, two workers with knowledge of the targets told Business Insider. Some lines are running at a small fraction of their previous capacity, and the company has thinned out a handful of Cybertruck production teams by more than half, these workers said.\nSince January, the carmaker has continued to move some workers from the line for the Cybertruck, which is made at its Texas Gigafactory, to the Model Y line, four workers said.\n\"It feels a lot like they're filtering people out,\" one of the workers said. \"The parking lot keeps getting emptier.\"\nA spokesperson for Tesla did not respond to a request for comment.\nDuring the first three months of 2025, Tesla sold 6,406 Cybertrucks, Cox Automotive estimated, half that of the previous quarter. Before the truck's release, Musk said Tesla had more than 1 million reservations for the vehicle. To date, it has delivered fewer than 50,000 Cybertrucks, a March 20 recall filing said.\nIn April, Tesla unveiled its cheapest version of the truck, a $70,000 rear-wheel-drive variant.\nTesla sales more broadly have been trending downward. This year's first-quarter delivery results, which are seen as a proxy for sales, showed a 13% drop from the same period in 2024.\nThe most recent Cybertruck production shift follows similar moves made in December, when the carmaker notified workers it would change Cybertruck production schedules and surveyed workers on their preferred roles. At the time, workers said they were told the company planned to scale back production targets for the electric pickup truck for the first quarter of 2025.\nTesla's lower delivery numbers come at a time when the company is facing pressure from all fronts. Competitors are edging in to compete with Tesla's aging lineup, demonstrators are staging protests outside showrooms, and the company's stock is down about 40% year to date.\nShares of the carmaker are still up more than 53% from this time last year.\nDuring a press conference at the White House last month, Tesla CEO Elon Musk promised to double the company's vehicle production rates in the US over the next two years.\nIn February, during the company's biannual performance reviews, Tesla asked managers to identify which roles on their teams were vital to the company, three current and former workers said. The company first added the query to employee reviews in February 2024. Workers were also ranked on a scale of one to five. The company eliminated a small percentage of staff during the reviews, two people said.\nHave a tip? Contact this reporter via email atgkay@businessinsider.com or Signal at 248-894-6012.

        "Tesla (TSLA) prices are continuing to fall in the used market — a good sign for buyers but bad news for current owners.\nTesla used car prices dropped 10.1% in March year over year, the biggest drop among the 10 auto brands that saw falling values in 1- to 5-year-old cars, per a new report from auto research site iSeeCars. Tesla’s slide was bigger than Chrysler's at 8.9% and Maserati's at 8.6%, two of Stellantis's most struggling brands.\nDigging deeper into the top 20 models with the largest price drops, Tesla’s EVs featured prominently. Four Teslas ranked on the list (Model S, Model Y, Model 3, and Model X), and the Model S sedan had the biggest year-over-year price drop, losing 17.2% of its value, or nearly $10,000 from a year ago.\nThe Model Y SUV, Tesla’s volume seller, lost 13.1% to an average price of $30,611, while the Model 3 sedan shed 10.9% to $26,084.\nDeclining resale values have become a bit of a trend for the brand. “In both the new and used car markets, Tesla prices have been dropping for over two years,” said Karl Brauer, iSeeCars executive analyst. “Price cuts on new Teslas immediately impacted used Teslas, driving their prices down at a rapid rate. The new car price cuts were driven by Tesla’s desire to maintain sales growth, but that strategy stopped working last year when the automaker saw its first decline in annual sales.”\nPrice cuts over the years for new Tesla EVs have weighed heavily on the used car market, as buyers were getting better value by buying new. And while that boosted new car sales, it crushed existing Tesla owners who were getting far less at trade-in and put the hurt on fleet operators like rental car chains, which took massive depreciation hits to their EV inventory.\nTesla's brand has also taken a hit due to the right-wing political activities of CEO Elon Musk, which have impacted sales both in the US and abroad. S&P Global Mobility reported registrations for Tesla vehicles in the US dipped 11% in January compared to a year ago. Though Tesla retained the top spot in terms of US EV market share at 42.5%, it represented a whopping drop of 12% compared to last year.\nFalling prices and dropping sales come as Tesla is set to report first quarter results after the bell on Tuesday.\nBrauer and iSeeCars see weaker results coming due to diminished demand.\n“Tesla has been one of the most profitable automakers in the world in recent years, but the ongoing drop in its new and used vehicle values, along with sagging sales, will be a drag on revenue and profit,” said Brauer.",
        "It didn’t take long for Elon Musk’s political advocacy and work in the Trump Administration to erode Tesla’s position as America’s uncontestable electric vehicle leader. As left-leaning consumers and outraged moderates complained about his crusade to remake the U.S. government, Tesla’s car sales declined in the first quarter of 2025 from the previous year. And, on Tuesday, the company reported a 71% decline in net income for the same period. All of this has been reflected in a share price that has declined more than 40% since its peak last December.\nAdvertisement\nAdvertisement\nNot too long ago, Tesla’s struggles would have been seen as a warning sign for broader EV takeup—and the push for decarbonizing transportation more broadly. The company was the first in the U.S. to market an electric car with mass appeal and remains the biggest purveyor of such vehicles stateside.\nBut the bigger picture has evolved: the success of EVs is no longer tethered to Tesla’s success. EV sales in the U.S. increased year-over-year for nearly every other automaker. In Europe, Volkswagen’s EV sales overtook those of Tesla, making the German company the continent’s top EV producer. Globally, Chinese automaker BYD was the best selling EV brand in the first quarter. Projections vary, but analysts still expect EV deployment to continue at pace—in the U.S. and around the world.\nTesla forged the path to EVs, but it may not be the leader that takes the U.S. all the way to an electric future.\nJust from looking at the numbers, it would be easy to roll your eyes at the suggestion that Tesla has lost any of its prowess. Despite the decline in sales, the company remains far and away the biggest seller of EVs. And, at the time of writing, it has a formidable financial position with a market cap of $880 billion—worth more than 20 times the Ford Motor Company.\n“The future of the company is fundamentally based on large-scale autonomous cars and large-scale, large volume, vast numbers of autonomous humanoid robots,” Musk said on the earnings call.\nBut there’s more to Tesla’s market cap than EVs. On the company’s earnings call this week, Elon Musk and other senior executives did discuss the planned release of a new, lower-priced model, but much of the focus centered on plans for autonomous vehicles and AI-powered robots. Indeed, its valuation, which is more than 140 times its earnings, can in large part be interpreted as a bet that the company will have new technology breakthroughs beyond just selling EVs.\nMeanwhile, the picture for other automakers is complicated, to say the least. Many have pulled back on their EV ambitions, nixing some of the most ambitious plans for new factories amid evolving consumer sentiment and political whiplash in the U.S. as the new administration pulls back supportive policies. Even still, legacy automakers continue to roll out new models to fight for market share—including a range of lower-priced EVs aimed at attracting less wealthy consumers. Chevrolet, Ford, and Rivian all have models coming down the road aimed at the middle of the market—and do so without the political baggage that Musk has attached to Tesla. Globally, Chinese EVs have entered new markets at a price point well below those of any Western manufactured cars.\nThere’s no question that the path ahead remains complicated for EV deployment—and decarbonization of the transport sector. But, for the first time, looking to Tesla may not provide such a representative view.\nTo get this story in your inbox, subscribe to the TIME CO2 Leadership Report newsletter here.\nThis story is supported by a partnership with Outrider Foundation and Journalism Funding Partners.

        "Uber CEO Dara Khosrowshahi said on Friday that he isn't sweating Elon Musk's robotaxis.\n\"I don't think that there will be a winner-take-all,\" Khosrowshahi told Semafor editor-in-chief Ben Smith during the publication's World Economic Summit in Washington.\n\"The drama is winner-take-all, but I think that the transportation industry is a trillion-plus-dollar industry,\" he said. \"You could argue that rideshare is going to finally beat personal car ownership in a world where you've got robots driving all over the place, so I think there will be plenty of room in the industry.\"\nKhosrowshahi said Uber would \"love to work with\" Musk's company. He also revealed that he owns a Tesla.\n\"Great car,\" Khosrowshahi said.\nAsked if he has tried full self-driving, Khosrowshahi responded, \"It is delightful, but I have to take over every once in a while. It is an absolutely great product. Again, the car is a terrific car.\"\nMusk isn't playing as nicely with his competitors in the autonomous taxi space. Earlier this week, Musk took a shot at Waymo during Tesla's Q1 earnings call.\nMusk said the problem with Alphabet's robotaxis is that they cost \"way mo' money.\"\nWaymo's ex-CEO brushed off the insult.\n\"Tesla has never competed with Waymo — they've never sold a robotaxi ride to a public rider, but they've sold a lot of cars,\" John Krafcik said in an email to Business Insider.\nUber and Waymo are partnering on autonomous ride-hailing in Austin and Atlanta. Tesla is aiming to roll out a \"pilot\" robotaxi service in Austin in June.",
        "If you haven’t been keeping tabs on Tesla’s stock price (understandable, it’s like the 1,025th most interesting thing that is happening in a world plagued by chaos), you’ve missed a whole lot of volatility. Crucially, you may have also missed its index displaying the dreaded “death cross,” a historical indicator of a likely downturn for the company.\nBusiness Insider called out the event, which has been hitting the stock indexes of some major players over the last couple of weeks as tariff trouble has hit just about everyone. Tesla is just the latest to see the symbol of bearishness, which occurs when a company’s 50-day moving average crosses and drops below the 200-day average.\nThe “death cross” showing itself for Tesla shouldn’t come as a huge shock, just given how wild a ride the electric vehicle manufacturer’s value has undergone in the last few months, spurred in large part by the fact that its CEO seems to be more interested in playing wrecking ball to the federal government than actually running the company. Tesla has seen more than a third of its value wiped off the board since the start of the year, despite some spikes along the way when it seemed like Musk might be able to eke out some preferential treatment from the Trump administration. He did get a free advertisement for the company in front of the White House, but that only came after widespread protests against the company put a dent in its reputation and future prospects.\nTesla is far from alone in flashing the “death cross.” The S&P 500 and Nasdaq 100 both showed it as well on Monday, as the indexes continue to fluctuate in wild and somewhat unpredictable ways thanks to the endless uncertainty that the Trump administration has introduced to the market through its blanket tariffs and “will they, won’t they” exceptions that keep getting tacked on and taken off.\nSeeing that Tesla got hit with the death cross might provide a little thrill in a Tim Walz laughing at Tesla’s declining stock price kinda way. But I have to be honest, as someone who is not fully immersed in the financial markets, the chart pattern reading kinda strikes me as astrology for guys in suits. Like, because the line displays a pendant shape, that means it’s primed to break out? What does that even mean? You might as well say it’s a good time to buy because Mercury is in retrograde.\nAnyway, analysts apparently don’t think death crosses are as reliable of an indicator as they are sometimes described by chart readers. According to Reuters, about half the time that a death cross appears, it marks the worst point for the index rather than a harbinger of a steeper decline. Regardless, it’s probably fine to taunt Tesla-maxxers with this news if you want an easy laugh.",
        "The one thing Elon Musk really can’t have right now as he serves as the absentee CEO of Tesla is more negative attention—not only can his ego not handle it, as a recent report from the Washington Post suggested, but his car company’s reputation really cannot suffer any more hits. So it’s hard to imagine he’s thrilled about Extinction Rebellion, the occasionally controversial environmental movement, spray painting the windows of Tesla dealerships with anti-Musk messaging at a time when his tarnished image is already seemingly costing the company money.\nFreedomNews.TV documented protesters with the non-violent protest group hitting up a Tesla showroom in Manhattan on Tuesday, using spray paint to leave messages in opposition to Musk’s Department of Government Efficiency. Demonstrators sprayed “Fuck DOGE” and “We do not consent” among other generally anti-Musk positions on the building as part of an Earth Day demonstration. It’s a pretty daring campaign given the Trump administration’s stated goal to crack down on those who vandalize Tesla dealerships and threats to hit the worst offenders with terrorism charges.\nIt also happens to come on the same day that Tesla is expected to report its first quarter earnings for 2025, in what some investors see as a potential make-or-break moment for the company. Tesla’s stock price has taken a hit over the course of this year as Musk’s role in government has drawn the ire of protesters and hurt the electric vehicle company’s brand.\nCertainly, the litany of demonstrations outside of Tesla dealerships has not been great for overall morale or the bottom line. Dealerships and showrooms have been the target of organized protests and seemingly less organized attacks that have included shooting out windows and setting vehicles on fire. Tesla drivers, embarrassed by the car’s association with Musk and in some cases afraid of getting heckled, have either ditched their cars or tried to cover their shame by covering up the branding.\nTheoretically, and certainly in Musk’s version of reality, environmental activists would support Tesla, seeing as it’s arguably the most noteworthy electric vehicle. But the thing is, when you throw your full weight behind an administration that straight up does not believe climate change is a real thing, intends to drill for more oil and burn more coal, and generally just revel in doing things that harm the planet, you kinda lose your credibility with that crowd.\nInstead, the world’s richest man is learning that you can buy a seat next to the President in the White House, but you can’t buy goodwill with the general public. It seems like it’ll be hard for Musk to put the toothpaste back in the tube on this issue. Even if he steps away from DOGE, which he might just have to do anyway due to the law, getting his reputation back among those most inclined to buy a Tesla is going to be a bit harder than just scrubbing off the anti-DOGE graffiti from a showroom window. That’s the kind of mark that stays with you.",

His remarks suggest a selective approach, with India welcoming global players like Tesla (TSLA, Financials) while keeping others at arm's length.\nGoyal said the government remains unconvinced that BYD will comply with India's rules. As of now, it's a no for BYD, he said, adding that multiple issues are informing the decision. He emphasized that India must be cautious about which international firms it lets in.\nThe minister traced today's global economic challenges to China's entry into the World Trade Organization more than two decades ago. The world was convinced that China would transform and be transparent, but it closed its eyes while China's growth was fueled by unfair trade practices, Goyal said.\nHe clarified that his past remarks about predatory pricing and hidden subsidies had been misunderstood, but maintained that over-reliance on cheap goods has helped create the current global instability. Despite recent turmoil in global markets, he said India has held up relatively well.\nGoyal defended India's 7% to 8% tariffs on U.S. imports as modest and necessary to protect domestic industries. Asked whether these would impact growth, he replied, I'm neither an astrologer nor an economist.\nIndia, he said, is open to fair bilateral trade with countries offering a level playing field. He also pointed to India's openness to foreign tech firms like Meta Platforms (META, Financials), in contrast to China's restrictions.\nHe noted the rupee's stability despite widespread currency slumps and expressed confidence in India's economic position.

        "You can catch Opening Bid on Apple Podcasts, Spotify, YouTube, or wherever you get your podcasts.\nWith all due respect to JPMorgan (JPM) and Netflix (NFLX), the most important earnings report of the early earnings season will come on Tuesday by way of embattled Tesla (TSLA). The EV maker’s stock has been run over since President Trump’s Jan. 20 inauguration day, plunging 43%. It’s not hard to find reasons for the tanking. The public’s rebuke of DOGE master and Trump supporter Elon Musk has translated into falling sales. Meanwhile, Trump’s 145% tariffs on China risk Tesla getting the parts it needs to profitably grow a business like the Cybercab while also operating successfully in the country. “The turnaround vision must start this Tuesday night on the earnings conference call for Musk and Tesla,” tech analyst Dan Ives says. Here are three things that Musk must do on the earnings call to begin rebuilding investors' sentiment in the stock:\nGovernment exit timeline: Musk must tell investors when he plans to exit his DOGE role and get back to 100% focus on Tesla.\nTariff impact: Musk (or other execs on the earnings call) must clearly quantify the financial impact of Trump’s tariffs on Tesla’s business.\nTurning Tesla around: Musk must articulate the turnaround plan for Tesla. Whether he likes it not, Tesla is now a turnaround story in the eyes of investors. The company may not be bloated cost-wise like typical turnarounds, but Musk has a lot to fix to get the top line back on track.\nFor full episodes of Opening Bid, listen on your favorite podcast platform or watch on our website.\nYahoo Finance's Opening Bid is produced by Langston Sessoms",
        "Elon claims that Tesla FSD can do 10k miles without needing any intervention. That is roughly once every year. Though he says this like it's a positive thing, that means you should basically never be getting into his robotaxis.\nFirst, his numbers are way better than what people with Teslas currently report.

        "New information has been revealed that questions Elon Musk’s leadership instincts.\nThe Tesla (TSLA) CEO is no stranger to controversial choices that cause both experts and investors to question his ability to lead the company. While the electric vehicle (EV) producer has risen to the top of its field, Musk’s antics have raised plenty of eyebrows.\n💵💰Don't miss the move: Subscribe to TheStreet's free daily newsletter 💰💵\nSince Musk began his tenure with the so-called Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), Tesla stock has mostly trended downward, and Wall Street sentiment toward it has also decreased. Even analysts who maintained highly bullish stances on TSLA for years have reduced their price targets.\nWith competition rising in the EV market, both Tesla and Musk are facing a highly uncertain future as consumers take a stand against the company. Now, a new report suggests that things could be about to get worse for Musk as a poor decision he made comes into focus.\nMusk ignored key warnings and Tesla may pay the price\nOver the past few years, the EV landscape has shifted rapidly, as competition has intensified. When this happens, industry-leading companies such as Tesla are forced to adapt, which typically means finding new ways to innovate.\nPart of Tesla’s growth strategy has focused on self-driving technology, specifically in pioneering its robotaxi. Known as the Cybercab, this autonomous vehicle is expected to be rolled out later this year, though with operations on standby. Experts have claimed that this means it doesn’t qualify as truly “self-driving.”\nElon Musk faces accusations from major tech rival\nRead More\nElon Musk faces accusations from major tech rival\nRead More\nThis has meant prioritizing the Cybercab at the expense of another new model, specifically the $25,000 Tesla Model 2 that fans had eagerly awaited for years.\nIt also seems that Musk’s decision to focus on highly priced robotaxis over more affordable daily driver EVs may have been ill-advised.\nAccording to a new report from The Information, internal analysts at Tesla warned Musk that the robotaxi “might never be profitable,” and could negatively impact the company in the long run. These experts noted that Tesla would likely be forced to keep the Cybercab mostly in the U.S., as obtaining regulatory approval in international markets would be challenging.\nHowever, they also noted that the Model 2 would be welcomed in markets such as India, Vietnam, and parts of Latin America, which would embrace a mass-market EV from a popular brand. However, that did not prove enticing enough to sway Tesla’s leader.\n“Musk hoped he could sell millions of Cybercabs to individuals and for ride-sharing, but the internal analysis pegged those sales in the hundreds of thousands,” Sherwood News reports. “Meanwhile, Tesla could have actually sold millions of the now defunct Model 2, the report said. Musk shot it down and refused to produce both the low-cost car and the robotaxi.”\nThis highlights the zero-sum nature of financial markets, in which a company opts to develop one product over another. Now, the Cybercab is facing new challenges, as the trade war with China threatens Tesla’s production plans and forces it to halt component shipments.\nMore Tesla News:\nTesla stock mega bull issues shocking price target\nTesla insiders, including someone unexpected, are dumping shares\nProminent Tesla shareholder has harsh words for Elon Musk\nOn top of that, China itself is making notable progress on the self-driving front.

At the time, this came across as particularly disappointing, as the current anti-Tesla push had not yet begun.\nElon Musk gets more bad China news\nRead More\nElon Musk gets more bad China news\nRead More\nNow that investors know that Musk ignored valuable insights from internal analysts regarding the Cybercab’s questionable profitability, his leadership will likely face even more scrutiny. Investors such as Ross Gerber have already called for him to step down, claiming it is in the company's best interest.\nThat said, this type of action seems to be on brand for Musk. In his 2021 book Power Play: Tesla, Elon Musk, and the Bet of the Century, author Tim Higgins reported he had fired anyone at Tesla who disagreed with him.\nIn this case, Musk appears to have cost his company a key opportunity at a time when Tesla desperately needs a growth-driving catalyst. Had he listened to his consumers, TSLA stock might be performing better right now.",
        "The U.S. Department of Justice announced on Monday that it charged Jamison R. Wagner, a 40-year-old from Albuquerque, New Mexico, with arson for allegedly setting fires at a Tesla showroom in the city as well as the local Republican Party headquarters. The charges come as Tesla CEO Elon Musk remains the focus of widespread public anger over his unlawful destruction of the U.S. government and his far-right extremist views about race and immigration.\nThe U.S. government alleges Wagner damaged two Tesla vehicles at the Tesla Showroom in Albuquerque, New Mexico, during the early morning hours of Feb. 9, 2025. One of the vehicles appears to have significant damage, according to a photo released by DOJ, but another vehicle appears to simply have a window smashed.\nThe DOJ alleges that an “intact glass container” was found in the second vehicle “containing an improvised napalm material.”\nThe building of the Tesla Showroom and six other vehicles on the property were hit with graffiti reading “Die Elon,” “Tesla Nazi Inc,” and “Die Tesla Nazi,” as well as swastikas. Musk, who’s still operating the so-called Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), infamously made two Nazi-style salutes on the day President Donald Trump was inaugurated on Jan. 20, 2025.\nMusk has denied he was trying to invoke the Nazis, but anyone with eyes to see can understand why reasonable people would assume the billionaire was welcoming the second Trump era with an explicit embrace of Nazism. The oligarch has embraced far-right ideology and expressed some extremely antisemitic and racist ideas over recent years.\nDOJ published photos it said were taken from surveillance footage appearing to show a person in a black hooded sweatshirt. It’s not clear whether that person is actually Wagner, though the government insists it is.\n“Hurling firebombs is not political protest,” Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche said in a statement posted online. “It is a dangerous felony that we will prosecute to the maximum extent. The impressive work by law enforcement in New Mexico sends a clear message to perpetrators of all of the shameful attacks on Tesla facilities and political establishments: we are coming for you, you can’t hide, and you will do serious jail time to pay for your crimes.”\nThe FBI issued a statement in late March noting that there have been attacks on Tesla-related property in at least nine states. And while Tesla CEO Elon Musk has tried to insist that attacks on Tesla facilities, along with peaceful demonstrations, are all being paid for by some shadowy figures, there’s no evidence that this is the case.\nDOJ also alleges Wagner attacked the Republican Party New Mexico (RPNM) office in the early morning hours of March 30, 2025. Two or three glass containers with flammable liquids were allegedly used to damage the door of the building, while the words ICE=KKK were spray-painted outside. Wagner was arrested on April 12, 2025, by agents from the FBI and ATF, according to the DOJ press release.\n“Let this be the final lesson to those taking part in this ongoing wave of political violence,” said Attorney General Pamela Bondi. “We will arrest you, we will prosecute you, and we will not negotiate. Crimes have consequences.”\nWagner has been charged with two counts of malicious damage or destruction of property by fire or explosives and faces 5-20 years for each of the two counts, according to DOJ.",
        "Tesla\nEvery Tesla vehicle is filled to the brim with modern and advanced features - and there is a massively complex network of devices powering that - from the FSD and infotainment computers, to the various networked sensors throughout the vehicle.\nThat massive network of wiring is traditionally run on a system called CAN, or the Controller Area Network - which was developed by Bosch all the way back in the 1980s. Since then, it has been the industry standard for in-vehicle part-to-part communication for decades.\nHowever, just like the horse and buggy, it may be time for CAN to be put out to pasture as it struggles in the data-driven modern environment. Massive amounts of sensor data, high-resolution infotainment screens, over-the-air (OTA) updates, and centralized Electronic Control Units (ECUs) mean that the old standard just can’t keep up anymore.\nTesla is now actively developing and deploying a next-generation vehicle network to replace CANBUS, and this new network will likely function in synergy with the move to the new 48-volt low-voltage architecture being pioneered by the Cybertruck.\nCANBUS - The Old Workhorse\nCANBUS was originally developed in 1983, released in 1986, and then standardized by the International Standards Organization (ISO) as ISO 11898 in 1993.\nIt’s a venerable standard that was revolutionary at the time, as it drastically reduced wiring complexity compared to the point-to-point methods being used in the late 80s and early 90s, and saw immediate mass adoption across the entire industry.\nCAN is a message-based protocol, where nodes broadcast data with identifiers. The priority of packets determines their movement and access. However, CAN 2.0 and CAN FD are both extremely limited - CAN 2.0 is limited to a glacial 1Mbps, and ~8Mbps for the more “modern” CAN FD.\nCAN FD barely makes the mark for 1080p video streaming at 60fps - if it is pre-encoded. Unencoded raw video surpasses what CAN FD is capable of, and greatly limits its capabilities and usages in a modern data-first vehicle like a Tesla.\nCAN is also complex - it is simpler than a point-to-point wiring system, but the multiple CAN buses and gateways result in a complex, heavy, and costly wiring harness that can be next to impossible to diagnose, repair, or replace.\nTesla’s Next-Gen Networking\nTesla’s next-gen networking is all about timing - and unlike CAN, where two messages coming in at the same time can collide (resulting in neither reaching the node), Tesla’s TDMA, or Time Division Multiple Access, assigns specific time slots. This means that access to each node or data point is guaranteed and avoids interference.\nYou can think of CAN being like everyone yelling in the same room - but TDMA being a tightly scheduled series of one-on-one meetings.\nHowever, TDMA isn’t just a simple sorting system. According to Tesla's patent application, the network operates in repeating cycles. At the start of each cycle, a Network Allocation Map (MAP) is transmitted. Think of this MAP as the dynamic schedule for that cycle – it tells every node exactly which time slots are reserved for which communications. Each reservation specifies the transmitting node, the receiving node, the duration of the slot, and, crucially, the type of traffic it is for.\nThis allows for sophisticated Quality of Service (QoS) management, separating data into different categories. The patent specifically calls out two main types:\nLow Latency (LL) Traffic: These are for critical, time-sensitive signals (think sensor readings for FSD, airbag triggers, control commands). They get assigned short time slots that repeat very frequently within the TDMA cycle (potentially every 500 microseconds, according to one example in the patent) to guarantee delivery within a strict maximum delay. The data packets themselves are kept small, maybe only tens of bytes, to fit these quick slots.\nBulk Traffic: This is for data where total volume is more important than millisecond-level delay (think infotainment data, camera video feeds, maybe larger data logs). These get assigned longer time slots, allowing for larger data packets (over 100 bytes in one example), ensuring high overall throughput even if they don't repeat as often as the LL slots.\nThis whole system relies on precise synchronization across all nodes. The patent mentions synchronization signals within the TDMA cycle and specialized modem hardware to keep everything perfectly timed.\nThe network can also be structured into logical domains (like front-left, cabin-right, etc.), each managed by a Domain Master node that handles the MAP and communication within that zone. So, TDMA isn’t just a sorting system; it's a highly managed network implementing traffic prioritization (LL vs. Bulk), dynamic slot allocation via the MAP, and potentially managed by centralized Domain Masters, all designed for efficiency and reliability.\n48-Volt and LVCS\nMany of these networking concepts appear designed to work hand-in-hand with Tesla’s recently-released LVCS - or Low Voltage Connector Standard. LVCS simplifies vehicle wiring networks by drastically reducing the number of connector types needed from over 200 down to just six. While the patent focuses on the data protocol, LVCS simplifies the physical layer, and the 48V architecture it's built on also enables using the vehicle's DC power lines as a potential network medium (PLC), helping to reduce complexity.\nTesla has been utilizing these new approaches in the Cybertruck, as evident in their new and unique interactive wiring diagram, which helps technicians debug wiring issues. We can expect even more features to take advantage of the new capabilities in the future.\n48V also means thinner wires, which reduces costs, and LVCS simplifies the connectors on both the harness and nodes - which means less part complexity, further simplifying the manufacturing and supply chain, while also ensuring vehicles are more repairable.\nWrapping Up\nThis is another innovation that Tesla is introducing to its fleet - and while we initially looked at it and thought, “Wires? How boring,” we soon realized that it is, in fact, the skeleton that Tesla will use to build its future systems.\nThat means smoother, faster, and more robust FSD data transfer within the vehicle, resulting in snappier and more effective decision-making. A quicker and more functional infotainment system and better support for deep-reaching OTA updates due to the reduced internal complexity and lack of reliance on internal CAN buses, which couldn’t be updated.\nThis is a massive technological leap over the decades-old CAN bus system, and while it may be invisible to the average user, it is an excellent example of all the engineering that goes on in under the hood of every Tesla vehicle.",
        "Tesla has highlighted an important 4680 battery cell milestone in recent weeks, noting that its Texas manufacturing team for the hardware has scaled production enough to outpace the cost-effectiveness of outside suppliers.\nDuring Tesla’s first-quarter all-hands-on-deck meeting held a few weeks ago, CEO Elon Musk shared a number of recent milestones. One of them, as was also reiterated after the meeting by Michael Guilfoy, Tesla’s Giga Texas Director of Cell Manufacturing, is the fact that the company’s in-house 4680 battery cells have earned their place as the lowest-cost battery cell produced per kWh.\nMusk also pointed out during the meeting that the achievement is particularly impressive, given that many of the company’s suppliers dedicate all or most of their businesses to battery cell manufacturing, while Tesla focuses on several other business sectors and still managed to surpass the milestone.\nCheck out Guilfoy’s full message below, as posted on LinkedIn, or watch Tesla’s Q1 all-hands meeting below that.\nBeen waiting to acknowledge this great achievement by Tesla’s 4680 Cell Manufacturing team since the end of last year….but as Elon announced last night, our Cell Manufacturing team in Texas reached a huge milestone at the end of 2024 with becoming the lowest cost per kWh battery cell producer for Tesla! The grit, determination, and passion of our team is unbelievable in helping deliver our mission.\nBig thank you to our entire engineering and production teams for making this happen!! It’s the greatest honor of my career to lead this team and make such an impact in our mission to accelerate the world’s transition to sustainable energy.\nAnd we aren’t done yet! 2025 will have more big milestones with fully ramped dry battery electrode manufacturing to deliver even more cost efficiency. Exciting teams continue to be ahead. Cheers to this world-class team!\nREAD MORE ON TESLA’S 4680 BATTERY CELLS: Tesla working on four dry cathode 4680 battery variants: The Information\nAlthough Tesla also sources its 4680 batteries from multiple other suppliers, including Panasonic and LG Energy Solution, the company has also been working to scale up in-house production of the cells over the past few years. In September, Tesla officially surpassed a milestone of producing 100 million 4680 battery cells, after surpassing 50 million last June, and exceeding 20 million in October 2023.\nTesla initially unveiled the 4680 battery cell during a 2020 “Battery Day” event, during which it explained the cost and efficiency benefits of the battery size in comparison with the 2170 form factor.\nTesla loses battle to keep 4680 battery tech under wraps\nA U.S. District Court Judge recently denied Tesla’s request to block Matthews International Corporation from selling its dry battery electrode technology worldwide. Dry battery electrode technology is the foundation of Tesla’s 4680 cells. Tesla filed a lawsuit against Matthews in June 2024. The EV automaker alleged that the manufacturing equipment supplier stole trade secrets related … Continue reading Tesla loses battle to keep 4680 battery tech under wraps",
        "Perhaps you’re an American waiting at a bus stop, in a country not your own, ruminating on the limits of democracy at home. A bus passes, and then another. You’re feeling low and, frankly, a little pissed off. (Perhaps you’re also running late. You’re always running late.) What could make you feel incrementally better? Doomscrolling, you see: federal layoffs, foreign-aid cuts, the dangers of A.I., a flurry of angry social media posts made at 3 A.M. You look closer at an advertisement on the side of the bus stop. “ELON MUSK IS A BELLEND. Signed, the UK,” it reads, using rude British slang for a male anatomical part. Aha!\nThis spring, as Musk has busied himself dismantling parts of the United States government, signs of discontent with the world’s richest man have stealthily appeared across London’s public-transport network. On the Tube, a fake advertisement for Tesla showed Musk doing a gesture widely received as a Nazi salute alongside the company’s plummeting stock price, with the caption “Hate Doesn’t Sell. Just Ask Tesla.” Another, plastered over a bus stop in Clerkenwell, in central London, featured Musk and Donald Trump together with a Tesla, and read “Autopilot for your car. Autocrat for your country.” On a bus stop in East London’s Bethnal Green, a sign branded Tesla “the Swasticar,” and announced that the vehicle “Goes from 0 to 1939 in 3 Seconds.” “Now With White Power Steering,” another read. The displays, though convincing, are not officially sanctioned. A spokesperson for Transport for London told me, in an e-mail, “These posters were not authorised by TfL nor our advertising partners and we have instructed our teams and contractors to remove any that are found on our network.”\nThe posters are not the only indicators of disarray: on Tuesday, after Tesla reported a profit drop of seventy-one per cent, Musk announced that he would be spending less time working with the Trump Administration. But why the hate in the United Kingdom? Outside of his work at the Department of Government Efficiency, Musk has devoted a surprising amount of time to trolling the country. In the past few months, he has made a barrage of posts meddling in the U.K.’s affairs. He has called for, variously, the incarceration of the Labour politician Jess Phillips; the incarceration of the Prime Minister, Keir Starmer; and the release of a far-right anti-immigrant crusader who goes by Tommy Robinson and had been jailed for contempt of court. (Robinson, who was banned from Twitter, in 2018, for violating its policy on “hateful content,” was reinstated after Musk bought the platform.) In January alone, Musk became fixated on a child-grooming scandal that took place in the North of England more than a decade ago; he fell out with Nigel Farage, the head of the far-right Reform U.K. party, seemingly over Farage’s refusal to support Robinson, writing that Farage “doesn’t have what it takes” to lead; and he suggested that King Charles III should dissolve Parliament and call a U.K. general election.\nRecently, Musk has turned his frenzied attention to the case of Lucy Connolly, and what he perceives as a lack of free speech in the U.K. Last October, Connolly, a white British child-care worker and mother, was sentenced to thirty-one months in prison for a post in which she called for hotels housing asylum seekers to be set on fire (Connolly is seeking to appeal). She shared it in July, after three children were fatally stabbed at a dance class in Southport. The tragedy ignited violent racial riots fueled by claims that the perpetrator was a Muslim immigrant. (He was not.) Earlier this month, Musk shared a post comparing the U.S. and the U.K.: the U.S. had “Fries,” “Airplane,” and “memes,” while the U.K. had “Chips,” “Aeroplane,” and “2 years in jail.”\nWhatever one thinks of Connolly’s sentence—and it is divisive in the U.K.—Musk’s motives for interfering seem dubious. His interest in British affairs has made him broadly unpopular with the public; a full eighty per cent of Brits dislike him, according to a YouGov poll from March. He has even managed to alienate Reform voters, a majority of whom now view him unfavorably. “To start with, it’s pretty weird,” Emma, a co-founder of Everyone Hates Elon, the group behind the fake Tesla advertisements, told me recently. “He’s a South African. He lives in America. Why is he putting fingers in our pie?” Emma is in her early thirties and lives in South London. Everyone Hates Elon grew out of a ranty group chat that she had with two friends. (Members spoke to me on the condition of anonymity. Names have been changed.) They would message about the news, and then they started to exchange “random ideas to troll Elon Musk.”\nTheir first plan was to create a crowdfund to which people could pledge to donate one pence each time Musk posted on X, “with the money going to causes he hates,” Jason, another co-founder, told me. (Musk typically posts thousands of times per month. The group is on track to raise about a hundred and fifty thousand pounds by the end of the year.) “We just had this idea to turn the hate he spews on his platform against him, and turn it into something positive,” he said. They printed and distributed stickers that read “Don’t Buy a Swasticar.” A couple of weeks later, they made a life-size cutout of Musk doing the salute-like gesture and attempted to install it in a Tesla showroom in North London. A video on Instagram shows Emma speaking with a sales representative. “Musk wants us to show the true colors of Tesla so we thought, you know, we’d do a bit of a revamp,” she says, deadpan, pretending to be from corporate. The video went viral. Later, Jason went to another showroom with custom air fresheners for the cars—“Musk B-Gone”; “Covers the stench of fascism”—and was swiftly escorted out.\nLast week, Everyone Hates Elon pulled off their biggest stunt yet. A private donor helped them secure a Tesla, then they set up an outdoor “rage room” and invited people to smash it. Around a hundred people showed up to participate. Each visitor was given around thirty seconds, a hardhat, and a sledgehammer. (They removed and recycled the car’s combustible battery first.) “I would never normally do something like this … but I’ve always wanted to smash a car,” a man named Giles Pearson told the Guardian. The remains of the Tesla will be crushed and auctioned to raise money for food banks. “It was super cathartic, and it felt amazing to be there venting our frustration,” Jason told me. (Tesla did not respond to a request for comment.) “What we try to do is channel our anger into some kind of creativity,” Emma said. “We want to make our activism in this stuff quite creative and appeal to lots of people.”\nNot long ago, I met up with Emma and Jason on a windy day near Waterloo station, where they had planned to install a fake bus ad. Emma had on a high-visibility vest over a short puffer jacket and was carrying a cardboard tube. “High-vis is essential,” she told me, putting up her hood. Jason agreed. “You put the high-vis on and people don’t really tend to question what you’re doing,” he said. They walked quickly toward a stop outside St. Thomas’ Hospital. For a few minutes, they attempted to open a case containing a stroller ad on the side of the bus stand. Locked. A bus passed; the driver looked at them without expression. They tried another one across the street. Open! Jason filmed while Emma unfurled an oversized poster and secured it inside the case. A man standing nearby holding a sandwich and a Coke stared at them. The ad was styled like an informational flyer one might see at a doctor’s office. “KNOW YOUR PARASITES,” it read, listing “Ticks,” “Worms,” and “Billionaires,” alongside images of Musk, Mark Zuckerberg, and Jeff Bezos. “Remove with wealth tax,” the poster advised. “Immediate intervention is crucial for your health, and the health of our communities.”\nAfterward, they jumped in an Uber and headed to a pub in Kennington, where they ordered plant-based burgers. Jason was already editing the footage for an Instagram post. Before founding Everyone Hates Elon, both he and Emma had worked on campaigns for progressive nonprofits, and they often found themselves stymied, stylistically. “It can be frustrating that organizations tend to do things in the same way, where there’s not any humor in what they’re saying,” Jason said. “They kind of talk in this impenetrable way that doesn’t reach anyone who doesn’t agree with it already.” He was drinking a non-alcoholic beer. He showed Emma a draft of the post, and she suggested he tweak the settings. “When you’re faced with threats from people like Elon Musk and Donald Trump, and how aggressive they are with their messaging, I don’t think the same old approach really works,” he said.\n“One of our frustrations is how quickly messages of the far right and the right spread,” Emma said. “Something as simple as ‘Make America Great Again’ or, like, Elon Musk’s tweets and memes, they spread so, so quickly. You can criticize them all you want, but actually they’re quite good at messaging.” She went on, “Often those progressive messages are just rubbish. They don’t reach enough people. It’s all, like, ‘Let’s love each other,’ or it’s really politically heavy.” With Everyone Hates Elon, they wanted funny messages that people could remember and repeat. “If all we can do is get people repeating ‘Elon Musk is a bellend,’ or ‘We should have a wealth tax,’ then there are two things we’re happy with, I reckon,” she said.\nOne appeal of the group’s messaging is its peculiarly British sensibility; the statements tend to cut through the noise. “I know everyone thinks we’re polite but, like, we call a bellend a bellend,” Emma said. (The term is roughly equivalent to “dickhead.”) “We can see someone like Elon Musk, and even Jeff Bezos, and other people, and it’s, like, they’re a bellend. They’re not cool, they think they’re cool. We don’t have time for it. Hopefully, this is something we can do to galvanize the U.K., and the rest of Europe, to say, ‘We don’t have to just sit here, we can actually say it how we see it.’ ”\nJason posted the video to the group’s Instagram and TikTok. In the following days, it went viral, drawing more than three million views. “He’s the richest private citizen in the world,” Jason said, before leaving. “We can’t outspend him. We don’t own Twitter. We can’t outcompete in that sense, but we know that we’re funnier than him. He’s definitely not funny.” ♦"
